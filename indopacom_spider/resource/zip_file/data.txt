Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: As the Army develops its replacement for the Reagan-era M2 Bradley, the\nOptionally Manned Fighting Vehicle\n, it’ll study OMFV’s ability to traverse roads and bridges in Indo-Pacific countries as well as Eastern Europe, the service’s director of armored vehicle modernization told me.\nThe reason? As Maj. Gen. Richard Ross Coffman, a tanker himself, emphasized in a\nCSIS webcast\nWednesday, while any conflict with China may start at sea or in the air, there’s no guarantee it’ll stay there – and in any land battle, you need armored vehicles, as shown by Pacific history from Iwo Jima to Hue.\nChina’s strategy has been to push for advantage around the globe, so a shooting war that starts in the\nSouth China Sea\nor\nSenkaku Islands\nmight metastasize to land battles as far afield as Africa, where\nChina has a growing presence\n, Coffman told the CSIS event. Or, as he put it to me afterwards: “China’s proven it will not self-limit in [peacetime] competition, so we cannot expect them to self-limit in [armed] conflict. The place and time of that conflict are yet to be determined, so we’ve got to be able fight no matter where we are.”\nThat brings us to the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, meant to transport infantry soldiers under armor protection and provide supporting fire during a foot assault. Instead of mandating a particular maximum weight,\nthe Army had asked industry to submit OMFV designs\nthat could safely traverse 80 percent of major routes and bridges in “pacing threat countries.” That had widely been interpreted as meaning\nEastern Europe\n– but now, Coffman says, it will include Indo-Pacific countries as well.\n“The bridges in Eastern Europe are fairly representative of many places in INDOPACOM [Indo-Pacific Command]; there are some better, some worse,” Coffman told me. “The Army needs to look and see... if you look at the Indo-Pacific region, do we need to be more restrictive?”\n(The Army is also building a light tank called\nMobile Protected Firepower (\nMPF), specifically to be easier to deploy to distant and difficult terrain than the massive M1 Abrams. MPF would be better suited to combat in mountains and jungles than Abrams, and it could provide heavy firepower to support the troop-carrying OMFV).\nTanks In The Pacific\nIt’s all too easy to assume armored warfare is a European phenomenon and armored forces aren’t needed in the Pacific theater, Coffman told the CSIS webcast. But in fact, 20\nth\ncentury history is full of tank battles in what’s now defined as INDOPACOM. That includes American lightweight Stuarts and mid-weight Shermans consistently outgunning Japanese tanks on Pacific islands in World War II. It also includes M48 tanks and M113 ACAVs – modified troop carriers rather like OMFV – clearing trails in the Vietnamese highlands and fighting for cities like Hue during the Tet Offensive. When North Vietnam finally conquered the south, it sent in armored columns, not just guerrillas. India and Pakistan have fought massive tank battles in their past wars, and India even\nairlifted light tanks\nto its Himalayan frontier to stop a Chinese offensive in 1962.\nToday, China itself has about 3,000 main battle tanks and 7,000 infantry fighting vehicles (armed and armored troop transports like the current Bradley or future OMFV), Coffman noted. “China has a long history of fighting on their periphery [on land]; they use armored vehicles, every time,” he said. “we have to be there with armor to prevent Chinese to getting into a position of relative advantage.”\nCoffman’s statements come in the context of the Pentagon’s escalating budget wars, as the Biden Administration looks to rein in spending while maintaining the Trump era’s focus on China as the “pacing threat.” The Pacific is historically a Navy-dominated theater, and competition with China has largely been framed in terms of sea, air, space, and cyber-power, not land forces. No less a figure than former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\npredicted a budgetary “bloodletting”\nin which ground forces were slashed in favor of sea and air.\nTrue, China has a long land border, but much of it is with Russia – currently an ally – and North Korea, a client state. And while Vietnam and South Korea have fought land wars with China throughout their history, US allies like Japan, the Philippines, and Taiwan are separated from China by water.\nHowever, China’s strategy of fortifying artificial islands in the South China Sea, and US investment in land-based missiles, suggests any naval war would involve clashes over island bases.

{"title": "ASTERX 2021: French Space Forces Reach For Higher ‘Orbit’", "publish_time": "2021-04-09 14:53:40", "author": ["Murielle Delaporte"], "content": "PARIS: France led its first multinational military space exercise last month, with Germany, Italy and the US, marking the country’s effort to re-vamp its forces and operations to meet 21st century threats.\nThe exercise signals the French government’s intent to reach for a higher ‘orbit’ as a sovereign nation in order to be able to face any future space conflict. Up until now, Paris was a participant in US-led space wargames.\nThe ASTERX exercise, took place in Toulouse March 8-12. It was described by Gen. Michel Friedling, head of the French Space Command, as a ‘’stress test’’ for the country’s space command processes and systems. A tactical exercise meant to train and prepare space combatants, ASTERX simulated an international crisis with no less than 18 different space events and scenarios ranging from an attack on a French satellite to space debris threatening civilian populations to an adversary jamming of allied SATCOM.\nAssessing future space operational needs through this kind of exercise is one of the first tasks for the government of\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron\nin its full speed effort launched in 2019 to overhaul the country’s space policy. The Covid pandemic has had a slight impact on that effort, postponing the launch of the military observation satellite CSO-2 spy satellite by a few months. (The satellite was launched in December from France’s spaceport in French Guiana, joining its sister CSO-1 in a 300km polar orbit.) By and large, the French military is moving apace in keeping with Paris’ determination to, at a minimum, keep its rank as the third international space power in an increasingly large and competitive club of nations.\nIndeed, 2021 already is set to be an especially busy year for French military space activities and organizational reforms. Three major thrusts are underway.\nRestructure Military Space Chain of Command.\nContrary to the US move to create a Space Force separate from the Air Force, France is developing an integrated French Air and Space Force (AAE for ‘’armée de l’Air et de l’Espace’’). The new combined force was officially stood up on Sept. 11, 2020 — a year after the French Ministry of the Armed Forces created a Space Command (CDE) to replace the 2010-established joint space command.\nThe AAE has now received its first officer, nicknamed “bébé espace” (literally space baby), directly assigned to a space position after graduation from France’s equivalent of the Air Force Academy. There currently are about 200 AAE personnel, spread among four different sites and centers – Paris (management), Toulouse (space operations, command and control), Lyon (a space situational awareness center called COSMOS) and an observation center called CMOS in Creil. The CDE plans to host 500 military staff by 2025 in a building of its own in Toulouse — for now, the command is co-located within France’s civil space agency, CNES.\nModernize Space Capabilities\nThe Defense Ministry (MoD) clearly is hoping to tap into the commercial space industry’s dynamism to be able to more rapidly develop modern capabilities.\nIn addition, the military activities of CNES — the space agency always has undertaken some dual-use operations, with about 12 percent of its budget now so oriented — keep growing.\nFor example, CNES will use the Ariane 5 heavy lift rocket to launch the first of two planned Syracuse IV military communications satellites, as well as the first of three planned Ceres signals intelligence. The next-generation Syracuse sats, being developed by an Airbus/Thales Alenia Space team, are scheduled for launch in 2022. A third satellite is projected for 2030. The first Ceres sat, built by Airbus Defence and Space, is slated for launch this year.\nCNES is also going to participate in research under the recently designated ‘Yoda’ program — named after the tiny but mighty, lightsaber-wielding Jedi master in\nStar Wars\n— for the development of France’s ‘patrol’ nano-satellites.\nAs announced by French Defense Minister Florence Parly,\nthe patrol nanosats would identify on-orbit threats to France’s satellites and, if deemed necessary, disable them using an on-board laser. The MoD is now looking at flying a tiny demonstration satellite under the Yoda effort in 2023; and hopes to be able to orbit a larger one with initial operational capability by 2030,\naccording to an October 2020 report\nby the National Defense and Armed Forces Commission of the French Parliament.\nPursue More Allied Cooperation\nFrance considers international cooperation as vital for both France and Europe in order to face the ‘new front’ of space threats, but also as a means to gain new opportunities. Germany and Italy, as well as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia and even India and Japan, are identified as key partners for France in\nthe 2019 military space strategy\n. The US is considered by France a critical partner for space military operations — one of the reason why France officially joined a year ago Space Command’s\nCombined Space Operations Initiative\n.\nIn addition, NATO just approved Paris’ request to locate a new Center of Excellence for space in Toulouse. Planned for this summer, this center will welcome 42 experts – among which are 17 foreigners – in charge of doctrine, analysis, training and exercises.\nASTERX is therefore only the first of many military space exercises, including with international partners, to come. The name of the ground-breaking exercise is in fact a tribute to the very first satellite France put in orbit, called Asterix, in 1965. And both, of course, pay homage to the famous cartoon character all French children have grown up with since 1959: Astérix, a very stubborn chief of a Gallic village in the Roman era, whose inhabitants’ worst and constant fear is that the sky will fall on their heads ... perhaps not such an irrational fear after all.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>PARIS: France led its first multinational military space exercise last month, with Germany, Italy and the US, marking the country’s effort to re-vamp its forces and operations to meet 21st century threats.</p>\n<p>The exercise signals the French government’s intent to reach for a higher ‘orbit’ as a sovereign nation in order to be able to face any future space conflict.

The CDE plans to host 500 military staff by 2025 in a building of its own in Toulouse — for now, the command is co-located within France’s civil space agency, CNES.</p>\n<p>Modernize Space Capabilities</p>\n<p>The Defense Ministry (MoD) clearly is hoping to tap into the commercial space industry’s dynamism to be able to more rapidly develop modern capabilities.</p>\n<p>In addition, the military activities of CNES — the space agency always has undertaken some dual-use operations, with about 12 percent of its budget now so oriented — keep growing.</p>\n<p>For example, CNES will use the Ariane 5 heavy lift rocket to launch the first of two planned Syracuse IV military communications satellites, as well as the first of three planned Ceres signals intelligence. The next-generation Syracuse sats, being developed by an Airbus/Thales Alenia Space team, are scheduled for launch in 2022. A third satellite is projected for 2030. The first Ceres sat, built by Airbus Defence and Space, is slated for launch this year.</p>\n<p>CNES is also going to participate in research under the recently designated ‘Yoda’ program — named after the tiny but mighty, lightsaber-wielding Jedi master in <em>Star Wars</em> — for the development of France’s ‘patrol’ nano-satellites. <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/07/france-envisions-on-orbit-lasers-for-satellite-defense/\">As announced by French Defense Minister Florence Parly,</a> the patrol nanosats would identify on-orbit threats to France’s satellites and, if deemed necessary, disable them using an on-board laser. The MoD is now looking at flying a tiny demonstration satellite under the Yoda effort in 2023; and hopes to be able to orbit a larger one with initial operational capability by 2030,<a href=\"https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/15/rapports/cion_def/l15b3465-tvi_rapport-avis.pdf\"> according to an October 2020 report </a>by the National Defense and Armed Forces Commission of the French Parliament.</p>\n<p>Pursue More Allied Cooperation</p>\n<p>France considers international cooperation as vital for both France and Europe in order to face the ‘new front’ of space threats, but also as a means to gain new opportunities. Germany and Italy, as well as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia and even India and Japan, are identified as key partners for France in <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/07/france-envisions-on-orbit-lasers-for-satellite-defense/\">the 2019 military space strategy</a>. The US is considered by France a critical partner for space military operations —  one of the reason why France officially joined a year ago Space Command’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/11/space-command-widens-embrace-of-allies/\">Combined Space Operations Initiative</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition, NATO just approved Paris’ request to locate a new Center of Excellence for space in Toulouse. Planned for this summer, this center will welcome 42 experts – among which are 17 foreigners – in charge of doctrine, analysis, training and exercises.</p>\n<p>ASTERX is therefore only the first of many military space exercises, including with international partners, to come. The name of the ground-breaking exercise is in fact a tribute to the very first satellite France put in orbit, called Asterix, in 1965. And both, of course, pay homage to the famous cartoon character all French children have grown up with since 1959: Astérix, a very stubborn chief of a Gallic village in the Roman era, whose inhabitants’ worst and constant fear is that the sky will fall on their heads ... perhaps not such an irrational fear after all.</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["Ariane 5", "CNES", "Combined Space Operations Initiative", "Emmanuel Macron", "Florence Parly", "france", "French Air and Space Force (AAE)", "French Defense Ministry", "Space Force", "Thales Alenia Space"], "categories": [], "img_data": [{"img_url": "https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/asterX1-768x432.png", "img_describe": "A screen shot from control center during France’s first military space exercise, ASTERX, in March.", "img_name": "news/img_2021_07_21_60f798cb435cc49f1f88d6b3.png"}], "video_data": [], "url": "https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/asterx-2021-french-space-forces-reach-for-higher-orbit/", "site_name": "breakingdefense", "insert_time": "2021-07-21 11:47:23"}

{"title": "A ‘Wake-Up Call’ For Defense IT, Comms Supply Chains: ODNI", "publish_time": "2021-03-18 20:57:18", "author": ["Brad D. Williams"], "content": "WASHINGTON: Joyce Corell of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told the public and private sectors today that the past year has been a “wake-up call” on the “fragility” of US information and communications tech (ITC) supply chains. It’s not just the weaknesses in domestic and international supply chains that were laid bare during the pandemic, Corell said. It’s also the recent, aggressive cyberespionage campaigns conducted by\nRussian\nand\nChinese\nintelligence services against US public and private entities.\nCorell, assistant director at the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told a\nvirtual event\nhosted by the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology that, “Everyone in the US and worldwide has learned about supply chain resilience since the pandemic. Supply chain issues are now dinner table conversations. We all saw how fragile some [supply chains] were and how resilient others were.”\nCorell noted that the SolarWinds campaign, in particular, demonstrated how “determined, persistent, agile, and stealthy” US adversaries\nare\n. (The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency yesterday\nreleased\na detailed description of SolarWinds threat actor tools, techniques, and procedures mapped onto MITRE’s\nATT&CK\nframework.) Faced with such adversaries, Corell urged the public and private sectors to adopt a risk-based management approach to supply chains, focusing on “criticality, prioritization, accountability, and transparency.”\nCorell highlighted the Biden administration’s recent\nexecutive order\nto review American supply chains, which gave special attention to semiconductors, high-capacity batteries, rare earth elements, and pharmaceuticals.\nDARPA-Intel Partnership\nCorell spoke on the same day the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Intel Corp. announced a three-year partnership to develop and domestically manufacture new structured Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) platforms for defense and commercial aviation electronics systems. DARPA and Intel’s partnership announcement arrives amid a global shortage of semiconductors, although the shortage is not the primary driver behind the partnership.\nThe DoD currently uses Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) in a variety of defense applications. DARPA’s SAHARA (Structured Array Hardware for Automatically Realized Applications) partnership with Intel is specifically focused on converting FPGAs used today to structured ASICs. SAHARA is seeking to optimize the relative costs and benefits associated with three chips: ASICs, structured ASICs, and FPGAs. These trade-offs include performance, power consumption, per-unit manufacturing cost, and security.\nSerge Leef, program manager in DARPA’s Microsystems Technology Office, told\nBreaking Defense\n, “A decade ago, many DoD applications moved to FPGAs and away from ASICs because FPGAs were viewed as a reasonable replacement. ASICs design and manufacturing costs were viewed as a poor match for DoD’s low-volume use cases.”\nBut today, he said, “Intel’s structured ASICs offer a compelling mid-point between ASICs and FPGAs. This gives the DoD a path to chips with higher performance and lower power consumption at lower design costs while minimizing unit costs. It may be worth noting that the structured ASIC concept has been around for 20+ years, but until recently, there was not a viable DoD supplier like Intel behind this technology.”\nThere are several advantages to structured ASICs relative to FPGAs. Leef explained, “Structured ASICs are compelling chip implementation vehicles as they offer ~50 percent advantages in performance and power as well as lower unit costs relative to FPGAs, which are commonly used in defense applications today. The amount of power consumed by FPGAs is becoming increasingly unsuitable for defense applications, such as Night Vision.”\nThere are, however, security risks with moving from FPGAs to structured ASICs, which SAHARA and Intel aim to solve. “A challenge is that structured ASICs, unlike FPGAs, contain the design information at the manufacturing time,” he said. “This is why SAHARA is working to address the need for security mechanisms to protect the designs during manufacturing in zero-trust environments.”\nBy contrast, Leef explained, “FPGAs are manufactured as ‘blanks.’ The design information is injected when the FPGA is in the hands of the end user or customer. The design information isn’t revealed to the manufacturer at any stage of the process. Structured ASICs, on the other hand, have the design information embedded into them. This design information can be accessed or compromised during the manufacturing, assembly, and test phases. Those are the stages of the process that SAHARA mechanisms are working to address.”\nThe nature of information accessible to structured ASICs manufacturers is one reason why Intel, a US-based advanced semiconductor manufacturer, is the commercial partner for chips to be used in defense applications. “It’s all being made within the US from beginning to end,” noted Intel’s José Roberto Alvarez, senior director, CTO Office, Intel Programmable Solutions Group.\nSAHARA will also look at ways to secure structured ASICs in “zero-trust environments” by developing “countermeasure technologies that enhance protection of data and intellectual property from reverse engineering and counterfeiting.”\nThe SAHARA partnership includes academic researchers from the University of Florida, University of Maryland, and Texas A&M.\nICT supply chain risks have really only begun to get serious attention over the past several years, Corell observed during her ICIT keynote. Almost no one talked about supply chain risk management more than a decade ago. The conversation has broadened in recent years to emphasize the inherently intertwined nature of US national security and economic security, Corell noted. This led to multiple initiatives to shore up the ICT supply chain over the past four years, including a flurry of executive orders and Congressional legislation.\nBut there is still more work to be done to secure American supply chains, especially in the defense industrial base. A Defense Department\nreport\nto Congress in January specifically highlighted supply chain issues. The report called for a “defense industrial strategy,” specifically calling attention to microelectronics (including semiconductors) and shipbuilding.\nHudson Institute Senior Fellow Bryan Clark and Adjunct Fellow Dan Patt recently\nwrote\n, here on\nBreaking Defense\n, on the need for a robust US strategy for microelectronics.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: Joyce Corell of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told the public and private sectors today that the past year has been a “wake-up call” on the “fragility” of US information and communications tech  (ITC) supply chains.

{"title": "Calling SolarWinds Hack ‘Act Of War’ Just Makes It Worse", "publish_time": "2020-12-21 22:13:31", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr.Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: As\nlawmakers\nstruggle to come to grips with the sheer magnitude of the Solar Winds hack “pretty clearly” executed by Russia, some have suggested the cyber intrusion amounts to an “act of war.” It’s not, multiple experts told us — and framing it as one could make it harder to solve the actual cybersecurity problem, which is as insidious as it is pervasive.\n“The depth and scope of the intrusion is breathtaking,” former top congressional intelligence staffer\nAndy Keiser\ntold us. “The scariest thing is the Russians could, and almost certainly will, lurk deep inside of our nation’s most sensitive networks, including those holding nuclear secrets, for months, if not years.”\n“I doubt the real impact will ever be disclosed by the government, even if it could be known,” one cybersecurity expert told us on condition of anonymity. “In many cases, they will need to start over to secure these networks.”\nWhy is this hack so bad? Hackers believed to be working for the KGB’s successor agency, the SVR, slipped malware into a regular update to SolarWinds’ widely used cybersecurity software. That gave them backdoors into every network using those SolarWinds tools, from private companies to the Pentagon to the builder and maintainer of nuclear weapons.\nNow, SolarWinds wasn’t used on networks carrying classified data, only on unclassified ones. Indeed, the Energy Department on Friday clarified earlier reports to stress that the hackers only accessed “business networks” and “has not impacted the mission essential national security functions of the Department, including the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).” One insider confirmed that the nuclear weapons networks are separate from those “front facing” business operations networks, saying there is no need for anyone to “have their hair on fire.”\nNonetheless, highly skilled hackers can sometimes turn a foothold on one network into a jumping-off point to penetrate another — even if the two networks are physically separated by what’s known as an “air gap.”\n“Don’t let anyone fool you,” said\nTerry Dunlap\n, a former NSA hacker who’s now Chief Security Officer at ReFirm Labs. “Classified data on a ‘different’ system can still be accessed, for example by air-gap jumping techniques.”\n“Once embedded in unclassified networks,” Keiser agreed, “Advanced Persistent Threat actors could potentially move into more sensitive networks, or gain access credentials to classified networks, particularly when given months or years.”\nArguably the most notorious example here is\nthe Stuxnet virus\n— attributed to the US and Israel — which slipped from the Internet into the air-gapped network used by the Iranian nuclear program. (Of course, Stuxnet was developed to compromise industrial SCADA systems, not for standard Windows-based systems.) Once inside, Stuxnet sabotaged the software on centrifuges used to enrich uranium and caused many to spin themselves to the point of breakdown.\nBut here’s a huge distinction between Stuxnet and SolarWinds — at least, so far. The SolarWinds hack doesn’t seem to have done any actual damage to either physical hardware or network functions. While the dividing line between acts of espionage and acts of war is increasingly blurry and much debated in the cyber age, collecting information without doing damage is hard to describe as “war.”\nThis (Doesn’t) Mean War\n“Espionage is not an act of war. Had they weaponized the attack — or if they attempt to later — that could be,” Keiser said. “To me, if you direct systems to create physical destruction or disrupt critical infrastructure, like an electric grid, using a cyber attack, that could be an act of war.”\nWhat counts as an “act of war” in cyberspace has been a hotly debated topic for years\nand it’s still painfully murky.\n“Hacking like this — especially to this extent — might go beyond espionage, but we don’t really have anything to say it’s unlawful under international law,” said Australian-based legal expert Cassandra Steer. “And let’s be clear, the US has engaged in similar activity, just never to this extent” — again, consider Stuxnet.\n“The problem in the world of cyber is that we are not dealing with armed attacks or armed force, but infringements of systems in a non-physical world,” Steer told us.\nWhile there’s no international consensus, she said, “the\nTallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare\nasked the question, what might amount to an unlawful ‘use of force’ in a cyber attack. …The conclusion was that if there are tangible effects in the physical world which amount to the same impact as an armed use of force would have, or the ‘scale and effect’ that a physical armed attack would have, then we can consider this to be the same and the relevant international law to apply.\n“As horrific as the ongoing impacts of SolarWinds are, I do not think they have reached this threshold,” Steer said.\nWhat if you don’t trust lawyers to tell you what war is? Well, you can consult your Clausewitz, the famous — and famously cynical — Prussian theorist of armed conflict. He wouldn’t consider this “war” either, said\nTom Mahnken\n, a veteran of long service in the Navy and civilian Pentagon posts who now heads the Center for Strategic & Budgetary Assessments.\nClausewitz defined war as “an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will,” Mahnken noted. “What remains essential to war is that it is meant to compel an adversary – to achieve political objectives. That’s not what this hack is about: It is a classic intelligence-gathering operation.”\nOr you could take a bluntly pragmatic approach. When lawmakers like Sen. Dick Durbin call the SolarWinds hack “virtually a declaration of war,” Mahnken said, “one could plausibly ask Senator Durbin whether he believes Congress should declare war on Russia over this ‘act of war’.\n“I suspect not,” Mahnken said tartly. “That says a lot about the difference between a real act of war, which would involve the loss of — potentially many — lives and great damage to US interests, and what we are experiencing here.”\nNow, even if the SolarWinds hack was not an act of war, that doesn’t mean the US cannot or should not retaliate against Russia, say some experts.\n“There are tools that the United States government and Cyber Command have at their disposal that have not yet been activated. That time is now,” Keiser told us. “Carefully and methodically unleash the hounds on offense — and batten down the hatches on defense.”\nOther experts, however, said a response in kind from Cyber Command may not be warranted, or wise. Several sources cautioned that a hack back could be counterproductive — escalating the situation toward actual military conflict. Given that the intrusion, up to now anyway, hasn’t crossed from espionage into any kind of damaging action, several sources said the best response may be a diplomatic one. “What do we do when we find a nest of spies?,” one source asked rhetorically.\nThe Best Defense?\nHow do we defend against another hack of this scale? That’s probably the hardest question of all.\n“Deterrence seems unlikely,” the anonymous cyber expert told us. “The targets are just too good for espionage, and attribution is hard. We have to build better systems and processes, which is hard, takes real dollars and is hard to test: If the other side beats you, they don’t advertise.”\n“There are some really, really smart people working on cyber in the US government right now. I know several of them,” said\nCharles Harry\n, an NSA veteran now with the University of Maryland. “It’s not that they didn’t know this could be a potential attack vector.\n“The cleverness of the attack [was that] they hid in the noise,” Harry told us. “The Russians basically blended into the environment. There’s a baked-in structural vulnerability.”\nCybersecurity companies like SolarWinds keep getting hacked because their software, in order to do its job, has to have high-level access to their clients’ networks. So instead of hacking one target at a time, he said, you get “economies of scale” by hacking the cybersecurity vendor, which gets you into all of its clients.\n“There absolutely are ways to fix this,” Harry said. “First and foremost...this is not purely a technical problem.” It’s about large, complicated organizations that don’t fully understand how their relationships with outside vendors make them vulnerable.\n“One thing is clear,” said\nMatt Wyckhouse,\nfounder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Finite State. “Despite the years of investments into layered cyber defenses, expert personnel, and new technologies, malicious actors were able to gain access to the most sensitive networks in the world by adding a simple, easy-to-spot backdoor into software used and trusted by all of these organizations. Why was this so effective? Because nobody bothered to look into the contents of the software update.”\nThe solution isn’t to pull the plug.\nThe Pentagon sees greater connectivity, not less, as essential\nto everything from\ndigital weapons design\nto\nAll-Domain Operations\nin combat. Senior officials like Air Force acquisition chief\nWill Roper\neven talk about creating a military “\nInternet of Things,\n” despite the tremendous security vulnerabilities in the civilian version.\nFor example, Roper explained, as the Air Force stands up new “digital factories” to design weapons using computerized design tools such as computerized 3-D models known as ‘digital twins,’ the attack surface potentially accessible to adversaries grows. “This creates a new kind of target,” Roper acknowledged to reporters recently. “They become crown jewels and they’ll have to be protected as such.\n“So we are pulling all the stops, and having red teams and cyber experts try to break our system to ensure that it is as tough as it can be,” he said. “But the other thing [is] zero trust technologies and doing continuous monitoring. We don’t do that in the Defense Department,” he admitted. “We certify things are impregnable.”\nBut in the modern era, what’s impregnable today may be exquisitely vulnerable tomorrow. That’s why you need to keep checking all the time — continuous monitoring — and have a multi-layered defense that assumes the enemy is going to get in — what is known as a ‘zero trust’ strategy.\nTraveling around Europe as a student, Roper recalled, he saw plenty of ruined castles. Their history, he said, proves that a single wall is never enough. In those castles Roper saw, the art of fortification included multiple lines of defense with multiple fallback positions, mottes and baileys, curtain walls and inner keeps.\n“Just having a single perimeter that your adversary is never going to get through — if that’s your plan, there’s a burned castle in your future,” he said.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p class=\"p2\">WASHINGTON: As <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/530784-lawmakers-ask-whether-massive-hack-amounted-to-act-of-war\">lawmakers</a> struggle to come to grips with the sheer magnitude of the Solar Winds hack “pretty clearly” executed by Russia, some have suggested the cyber intrusion amounts to an “act of war.” It’s not, multiple experts told us — and framing it as one could make it harder to solve the actual cybersecurity problem, which is as insidious as it is pervasive.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“The depth and scope of the intrusion is breathtaking,” former top congressional intelligence staffer <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/11/we-must-rebuild-american-uranium-rare-earths-infrastructure/\">Andy Keiser</a> told us. “The scariest thing is the Russians could, and almost certainly will, lurk deep inside of our nation’s most sensitive networks, including those holding nuclear secrets, for months, if not years.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“I doubt the real impact will ever be disclosed by the government, even if it could be known,” one cybersecurity expert told us on condition of anonymity. “In many cases, they will need to start over to secure these networks.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Why is this hack so bad?

{"title": "Operational Comms, Missile Tracking Sats Up In 2024: SDA", "publish_time": "2021-02-11 22:24:05", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: The\nSpace Development Agency (SDA)\nplans to issue a request for proposals this summer for some 150 satellites to provide “initial warfighting capability” for communications and missile tracking, says SDA Director Derek Tournear.\nThe new satellites, to be launched in September 2024, will comprise what SDA calls “Tranche 1” of its planned seven-layer\nNational Defense Space Architecture.\nThey will follow-on the\n20 Transport Layer satellites\nfor porting data to users and the\n10 Tracking Layer missile warning and tracking sats\nplanned for launch in March 2023 to demonstrate capabilities, Tournear told the SmallSat Symposium today.\nAccording to the slides Tournear presented today, the Tranche 1 satellites will allow “persistent regional access” for warfighters on the ground. “Tranche 1 is going to be a big deal,” he said.\n“The news from SDA is fantastic!,” enthused Steve Nixon, president of the SmallSat Alliance. “They are demonstrating the kind of rapid space innovation that is possible when acquiring smallsat capabilities. The pace and scale of this effort would simply not be possible if SDA approached space in the traditional manner.”\nThe overall goal of SDA’s National Defense Space Architecture is to enable resilient beyond-line-of-site targeting for time-sensitive ground and maritime targets, and to provide hypersonic/advanced missile threat warning and tracking, Tournear explained.\nIn other words, the idea is to provide a backup network to DoD’s current satellite constellations — for everything from military communications; to positioning, navigation and timing (PNT); to missile warning and tracking; and to imaging of targets on the ground by using a multitude of small satellites based in Low Earth Orbit (LEO, up to 2,000 kilometers in altitude.)\nCurrent constellations, by contrast, are each made up of handfuls of large, extremely expensive (some in the billion-dollar-apiece range) birds based in Geosynchronous Orbit (some 36,000 kilometers) which, — in the immortal words of\nGen. John Hyten, now the Vice Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — make “big, fat, juicy targets”\nfor adversaries.\nThe Transport Layer constellation, which will comprise 300 to 500 satellites, is designed to form the “backbone” communications network that eventually all DoD command and control (C2) systems will link into,\nunder a May order by former Defense Secretary Mark Esper.\nThe aim of Esper’s mandate was to set up the SDA Transport Layer as a key space node to enable\nJoint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2).\n“That’s the backbone. That’s how we tie everything together to make sure I can have high bandwidth, low-latency communication directly to the end user on the ground,” Tournear said. (Low latency means a minimum delay caused by the fact that satellites are far away from their ground receivers.)\nMore specifically, the Transport Layer is a “mesh network of hundreds of satellites, all optically interconnected, that provides a low-latency data comm network, and also provides connectivity directly down to existing tactical data links — notionally\nLink 16 —\nwhich is one of the tactical data links that the department uses to be able to talk to weapons systems,” Tourner told the symposium. “So, we’re not fielding new equipment to the user on the ground, we’re going over their existing tactical data links from that Transport Layer.”\nWhen the Transport Layer Tranche 1 satellites are up and working, they will provide “low latency data connectivity; data directly to weapons; and data disseminated to the theater,” Tournear’s slides elaborated.\nSDA awarded Lockheed Martin and newcomer York Space Systems\ncontracts to build 10 data relay satellites each\nfor the Transport Layer’s Tranche 0, to be orbited by 2023. Lockheed Martin’s contract is worth $187.5 million; York’s is worth $94 million.\nThe Tracking Layer satellites are one of three sensing constellations included in SDA’s architecture, along with a “Custody Layer” of ISR satellites for detecting and tracking ground targets, and, eventually, a Deterrence Layer of space domain awareness satellites\nthat could include a constellation monitoring cislunar space.\nThe missile warning/tracking satellites included in Tranche 1 will provide “detection of HGVs [hypersonic glide vehicles] and other advanced missile threats; targeting quality data; and communication directly with C2BMC,” Tournear’s charts show.\nSDA\nin October awarded SpaceX $149 million and L3Harris $194 million\nto each build four satellites for the agency’s Tracking Layer Tranche 0. And the\nMissile Defense Agency\nawarded L3Harris and Northrop Grumman contracts to each develop a prototype satellite to carry the medium field of view\nHypersonic and Ballistic Space Sensor (HBTSS)\nfor the Tracking Layer. L3Harris’s contract worth $121 million was awarded on Jan. 14; and Northrop Grumman’s $155 million on Jan. 22. Those satellites also are all expected to be on orbit by 2023.\nRegarding the Custody Layer for ground targeting, Tournear explained that this will involve figuring out how to link existing satellites — both commercial imaging satellites and spy satellites operated by the NRO — into SDA’s Transport Layer. SDA has no plans to build its own imaging satellites, he said.\nMore immediately, SDA’s work this year and next will focus on the Tranche 0 demos of various capabilities for the Transport and Tracking Layers, as well as some ground system elements.

The pace and scale of this effort would simply not be possible if SDA approached space in the traditional manner.”</p>\n<p>The overall goal of SDA’s National Defense Space Architecture is to enable resilient beyond-line-of-site targeting for time-sensitive ground and maritime targets, and to provide hypersonic/advanced missile threat warning and tracking, Tournear explained.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the idea is to provide a backup network to DoD’s current satellite constellations — for everything from military communications; to positioning, navigation and timing (PNT); to missile warning and tracking; and to imaging of targets on the ground  by using a multitude of small satellites based in Low Earth Orbit (LEO, up to 2,000 kilometers in altitude.)</p>\n<p>Current constellations, by contrast, are each made up of handfuls of large, extremely expensive (some in the billion-dollar-apiece range) birds based in Geosynchronous Orbit (some 36,000 kilometers) which, — in the immortal words of <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/06/shifting-gears-dod-moves-to-leo-for-future-opir-sats/\">Gen.

That’s how we tie everything together to make sure I can have high bandwidth, low-latency communication directly to the end user on the ground,” Tournear said. (Low latency means a minimum delay caused by the fact that satellites are far away from their ground receivers.)</p>\n<p>More specifically, the Transport Layer is a “mesh network of hundreds of satellites, all optically interconnected, that provides a low-latency data comm network, and also provides connectivity directly down to existing tactical data links — notionally <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/link-16/\">Link 16 —</a> which is one of the tactical data links that the department uses to be able to talk to weapons systems,” Tourner told the symposium. “So, we’re not fielding new equipment to the user on the ground, we’re going over their existing tactical data links from that Transport Layer.”</p>\n<p>When the Transport Layer Tranche 1 satellites are up and working, they will provide “low latency data connectivity; data directly to weapons; and data disseminated to the theater,” Tournear’s slides elaborated.</p>\n<p>SDA awarded Lockheed Martin and newcomer York Space Systems <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/09/link-16-to-tie-legacy-platforms-to-sda-satellites/\">contracts to build 10 data relay satellites each</a> for the Transport Layer’s Tranche 0, to be orbited by 2023.

Put those three references in Lloyd Austin’s written responses to the Senate Armed Services Committee together and you’ve got a pretty idea of the (expected) shift in the Biden administration’s rhetoric.\nWhat’s the shift? The language signals that the Biden team wants to “start to lean away from … the pugilistic aspects of what’s been articulated [by the Trump administration] to the ‘more resilience’ aspects,” said one space policy wonk in the know. “We all know that’s going to be the case; we don’t know how hard that lean will be, and how fast that lean will go.”\n‘Kremlinology’\nInterpreting written testimony from incoming administration nominees for DoD posts is an art — often reminiscent of Cold War era Sovietologists comparing photos of the Kremlin to see who is standing where at what time, and who has been brushed out. In most cases, the testimony and answers to written questions have been crafted by a committee, made up of both outgoing DoD officials as well as transition team members and even outside advisors, rather than the principals. Sure, the principal reviews the drafts, but unless there is an issue about which that person feels strongly, the word-smithing is crafted to be as vague as possible so as to hew the organizational line and offend no one on the Hill.\nIn reality, at this early stage for Biden nominees, “there’s no formulated policy; there’s no formulated direction,” one expert said.\nBut there are always clues and Austin’s Q&A is no different. For example, his responses use the word “resilience” five times, and the word “warfighting” four times. Further, one of those four mentions of warfighting is in a sentence explaining how “resilience” is key to maintaining US capabilities during any conflict; another is about how space capabilities support other services.\nOf course, no one expects DoD and the Space Force to suddenly eschew taking up arms — indeed, Austin clearly articulated the current Pentagon stance that the US needs both defensive and offensive capabilities to counter Chinese and Russian threats. That said, Austin’s answers just as clearly represent a change in tonality toward a different balance in emphasis.\nSpace Force, Space Command roles\nAsked about any changes to the\n2018 National Defense Strategy\nregarding space he might recommend, Austin said: “Since the NDS was developed, the recognition of\nthe central role space plays in supporting other services in their warfighting role\n(emphasis ours) continues to grow. If confirmed, I will ensure the space domain is carefully considered across the range of upcoming strategic reviews.”\nThe shout-out regarding the mission of Space Force and Space Command to support other services and other types of military operations is noteworthy, given the loud DoD public relations campaign during the Trump era — led by\nGen. Jay Raymond\nwho at one time commanded both — to assert a shift to space operations as\nwarfighting operations.\nRaymond and other senior officers repeatedly stressed that the force was moving beyond its traditional support role.\nAustin said that because the strategic environment, especially regarding space, is evolving rapidly, it would be advisable to consider policy shifts.\n“For space in particular, I would account for the continued growth of adversary space and counterspace capabilities, as well as the adequacy of the steps the United States has taken to improve the DoD space enterprise to address growing threats and challenges in the domain. I would also emphasize the\nrole of resilience in improving our warfighting capability,\n(emphasis ours) the role of allies and partners, and space-related information sharing. Lastly, I would highlight growing commercial activities in space which can both be threats to and opportunities for the United States.”\nFurther, in response to a question about his advice to Space Command about military space operations, Austin again stressed measures to protect US assets that don’t include offensive options for taking the fight to adversaries.\n“The command must be able to protect and defend US interests, and in particular be able to manage escalation and crises in space. I would also direct that DoD space activities contribute actively to shaping a space domain that is secure, stable, and accessible and to deterring threatening or irresponsible behavior in space. This would require that in addition to nurturing technology innovation in-house for resilience, SPACECOM work within the Department and across the government to build strong alliances in space, develop norms and standards of behavior, and increase partnerships with commercial space entities,” he said. “Lastly, the commander should emphasize not just wartime roles of space warfighting, but also peacetime roles of ensuring access to space for the US and our allies.”\nThreats and DoD response.\nTo no one’s surprise, Austin stressed China as the “pacing threat” for US military space capabilities. But in the very next sentence, Austin called for development of\nnorms of behavior\nto help staunch great power competition with China and Russia. (Interestingly, “China” and “norms” both appear four times in the Q&A.)\n“Given the importance of space in affecting our economic competitiveness, it is essential to continue developing best practices, standards, and international norms of behavior in space. Development of global norms of behavior in space will also deter threatening behavior, and uphold the rights of all nations to use space responsibly and peacefully,” he said.\nAustin went on to note that threats to national security space assets are not just from adversaries bent on degrading or destroying them — there are also threats from unregulated activities by non-hostile countries and commercial actors that could pollute orbital regimes or otherwise harm satellite operations.\n“Other countries not considered adversaries or hostile to US interests are conducting space activities of concern, and there are few norms or guidelines to dictate how it should be done. This lack of transparency in the space domain is a risk to U.S assets and cause for concern,” Austin explained. “Last but not least, growing private activities in space (according to some projections, there will be as many as 54,000 new satellites in orbit in the next decade, mostly privately-owned and operated) are a risk to the United States in the sense that the government needs to ensure that they do not collide with expensive and exquisitely capable government assets.”\nWither Space Acquisition?\nWhile Austin also addressed the long-burning question of how DoD will organize its myriad bureaucratic agencies/entities charged with space acquisition, his answers revealed little about what the Biden administration might actually do.\nCLARIFICATION BEGINS:\nA Department of the Air Force spokesperson clarified that Shawn Barnes, who currently is the de facto space acquisition lead and is continuing to serve during the transition, “did not write the responses for Austin’s testimony, although he did contribute information related to space acquisition to OSD for their use in assisting Gen.

Instead, it has suggested that <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/07/air-force-wants-more-time-on-space-acquisition-czar/\">SDA be able to remain independent until at least 2023.</a></p>\n \n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["air force", "Gen.

{"title": "Why Was The SolarWinds Campaign So Difficult to Detect?", "publish_time": "2021-03-17 11:30:18", "author": ["Brad D. Williams"], "content": "WASHINGTON: Continued investigation reveals just how technically advanced the SolarWinds hack was — and how challenging it must have been to execute. By comparison, exploiting the zero-day vulnerabilities recently\ndisclosed\nin Microsoft’s Exchange software is child’s play.\nPublic and private sector officials continue to openly question how it’s possible the U.S. government failed to detect the SolarWinds cyberespionage campaign. Some have said that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s\nEINSTEIN\ntechnology should have detected the attack. Others point to failures in the security architecture, technologies, and processes at government entities, including the 12 known to have been compromised in the hack. Some of that may be true, but it also overlooks some truly remarkable aspects of this hack, at the risk of underestimating this threat actor and misjudging effective solutions.\n(Notably, U.S. Cyber Command Executive Director Dave Fredrick\nsaid\nat a virtual event last week that there’s “no evidence” Defense Department networks were compromised by this cyberattack.)\nFollowing the campaign’s discovery, the National Security Agency\nurged\nfederal and defense entities to adopt a zero-trust security model.\nWhy did so many public and private entities for months fail to detect the hack? Why did only one of the tens of thousands of victims eventually find it? To answer these questions, it helps to return to the Feb. 23 Congressional\ntestimony\nof FireEye CEO Keven Mandia, as well as to what threat intelligence and forensics evidence have revealed since its discovery. FireEye discovered the hack after it became a “stage two” victim.\nStage one of the hack entailed the threat actor compromising SolarWinds Inc. and its Orion software by stealthily inserting a backdoor into a software update. Stage two victims include anyone who downloaded the legitimate, yet compromised, update that was hacked during stage one. Some have characterized the hack as “discriminate,” while others have said it was “indiscriminate.” The hack was, in fact, both: highly discriminate in stage one and largely indiscriminate in stage two.\nThreat actors implemented excellent operations security to avoid being detected and used many stealthy tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) during the hack.\nMandia told Congress the SolarWinds hack is just the latest in what has been a “multi-decade campaign” for this threat actor. Microsoft President Brad Smith, who testified in the same hearing, said his internal security team estimated the SolarWinds hack involved the work of “at least 1,000 engineers.” Given that type of time frame and resourcing, it’s perhaps possible to begin to appreciate what the threat actor achieved in this hack.\nAs to one factor that complicated detection, a key step in the second stage of the hack involved compromising Microsoft’s Active Directory in breached organizations. Active Directory stores an organization’s IT user accounts (i.e., names and passwords) and associated access controls, which permit or deny users privileges to and permissions for IT resources, such as applications, servers, and files.\nGaining administrative control over Active Directory enables threat actors to pose as legitimate IT users within breached organizations, to authenticate using valid credentials, to lift user access controls, and to create new accounts, among other activities. Without specific types of security monitoring, such as anomaly-based detection baselined against typical user behavioral patterns, threat actors are free to move throughout an organization’s IT systems posing as a legitimate user, with no flags ever being raised. This, of course, posed a huge challenge to detecting the threat actor once it was inside breached organizations’ networks.\nWhile the Active Directory hacks certainly complicated detection of threat actors on compromised networks, it’s not an uncommon step taken as part of advanced persistent threats. There is, however, one aspect that stands out as truly remarkable in what was generally a remarkable hack.\nOne of the most common methods for hacking software is to change the source code, but that’s not what happened at SolarWinds, according to Mandia. Instead, the threat actor modified the\nsoftware build process\n. This is important to remember and understand, because it has potentially far-reaching ramifications going forward. Modifying the software build process, based on what’s known today, is a novel threat vector.\nThe software build process is a step in the software development life cycle. The build process converts high-level computer code written by human programmers, in a language such as C++ or Java, into low-level machine code, which is what computers actually process and execute as instructions. This conversion — from high-level programming language to low-level machine code — is what software developers call “compiling” the code.\nThe software build process is usually the last step before code is deployed into “production environments,” which are where organizations’ employees actually use the software. In the case of SolarWinds, the company deployed the compromised Orion code to approximately 17,000 customers, according to Mandia. Again, any organization that downloaded the legitimate, yet compromised, software update was instantly breached via the inserted backdoor and became a stage two victim in the hack.\nImportantly, based on public information to date, it appears the threat actor conducted second-stage attacks against only a small percentage of the 17,000 total organizations breached. But questions remain about how many organizations are still breached today and what exactly was stolen from the approximately 200 organizations estimated to have been actively targeted in second-stage hacks.\nNot only is modifying the software build process a “unique” attack vector, as Mandia said, it’s difficult to achieve. So challenging and unique is this vector that, as a precautionary measure to ensure its success, the threat actor carried out a “dry run” of the attack using harmless code in October 2019 to make sure it worked. Only later, satisfied that its proof-of-concept had been demonstrated, did the threat actor launch the actual attack in March 2020.\nOne concerning aspect, given the nature of the attack vector, is this: Modifying the software build process, rather than the source code, means that “this is a more portable attack than just at SolarWinds,” Mandia said.\nEven FireEye, which specializes in breach investigations and employs thousands of highly trained experts in digital forensics, was nearly bamboozled during the investigation into its own compromise. Mandia said FireEye dedicated nearly 100 employees, most with 10,000 hours of prior forensics investigation experience, to discovering how the company was breached. “After exhausting every investigative lead,” Mandia said, the company’s experts opted to take a radical approach.\nThe investigators had traced the earliest indication of compromise to a SolarWinds server. Mandia said the experts decided to “tear [the server] apart.” That is, they “decompiled” the code. Then they sifted through 18,000 files, 3,500 executable files, and over 1 million lines of assembly code that were installed as part of the compromised SolarWinds software update.\nAssembly code is a low-level computer language that consists of symbolic equivalents to machine code. It’s one step above the lowest-level machine code in the continuum between low and high languages. Programs can be written in assembly language, but very few choose to code this way today.\nJust reading assembly language is an exacting skill. Conducting a forensics investigation based on assembly code is a highly specialized sub-field within cybersecurity. Few cybersecurity professionals possess this skill, and even fewer organizations employ such experts full time. FireEye just happens to be one of them.\nThe task FireEye investigators undertook is perhaps not quite as difficult as searching for a specific grain of sand on the beach, but after a few hours of this work, you would likely conclude there isn’t a material difference between the two. (You can try reading assembly language samples\nhere\n. Note that this code is fairly well-documented compared to what’s often encountered by forensics investigators.)\nSo, after nine months of investigation by 100 highly trained and experienced cybersecurity forensics experts, FireEye finally discovered the “proverbial needle in a haystack” — a malicious “implant” in SolarWinds assembly code — in December 2020.\n“You wonder why people missed it,” Mandia told Congress. “This is not the first place you would look. This is the last place you’d look for an intrusion.”\nAnd, Mandia warned, “There’s no magic wand to say where’s the next implant.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: Continued investigation reveals just how technically advanced the SolarWinds hack was — and how challenging it must have been to execute.

Probably the biggest support that the IC can provide is professional all-source intelligence analysis to connect the dots between sparse information and what is really going on. Classified sources and the ability to connect the dots are increasingly necessary given the extent to which authoritarian regimes like the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) go to censor and hide human rights abuses.\nBut to fully engage on human rights issues, the IC would need to become even more comfortable working with open-source information, since the vast majority of reporting on human rights is done in the open by non-profits.

{"title": "NSA About To Release Unclassified 5G Security Guidance", "publish_time": "2021-04-07 21:31:21", "author": ["Brad D. Williams"], "content": "WASHINGTON: The National Security Agency, working with others, is creating new unclassified 5G security guidance to be published this spring, NSA Executive Director Wendy Noble said today.\nIt will “outline threats and risks to 5G infrastructure,” Noble said and be based on work by the Enduring Security Framework (ESF), which is “currently assessing 5G adoption across the threat landscape and examining ways to minimize those risks to the US.”\n“Looking out on the 5G security horizon,” she said, “[NSA’s internal] research organization is investigating the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in mitigating security risks. They are developing data analytics to define expected behavioral patterns, identify anomalies, and implement the zero-trust model. We look to data analytics to provide insight into network automation and orchestration, given the large amount of data that will traverse 5G networks and overwhelm network managers.”\nThe ESF is a public-private partnership between the NSA, Defense Department, Department of Homeland Security (specifically, CISA), Intelligence Community, and companies within the US IT and defense industrial base sectors. The ESF’s charter is to address threats and risks to the security and stability of US national security systems and critical infrastructure, Noble noted.\nThe guidance is one way NSA is “focusing our expertise in cryptography and cybersecurity to help industry and government to integrate security into all aspects of the 5G ecosystem,” Noble said in a keynote at\nAFCEA DC’s 2021 5G Defense Tech Summit\n. The guidance will be published on NSA’s website “sometime this spring,” Noble said.\n“The cumulative goal” of ESF’s work on 5G “is to jointly improve the ability of the 5G infrastructure to identify and build threat models, detect threats in networks, recover from attacks, and securely leverage the benefits of virtualization,”\naccording\nto NSA.\nNoble’s speech highlighted the importance of zero-trust architecture in 5G networks. The NSA recently\nurged the defense sector to adopt a zero-trust security model\nin the wake of the\nSolarWinds cyberespionage campaign\n. Given Noble’s emphasis today on zero-trust security models and supply chain risks — as well as the fact that the SolarWinds breach was on the\nagenda\nfor ESF’s January meeting — it’s reasonable to expect that future NSA 5G security recommendations will emphasize zero trust as a key component.\nNSA has\ncharacterized\nzero trust as “a security model, a set of system design principles, and a coordinated cybersecurity and system management strategy.” It’s a “data-center centric” approach to security, which assumes the worst — that an organization is already breached or will be breached. Based on “assumed breach,” zero-trust models apply the security principle of “least privilege” to every user and node in a network, enforced with risk-based access control, security monitoring, and security automation.\nNoble noted today, “The zero-trust model is predicated on encryption algorithms and key exchange processes that are quantum resistant. Likewise, fine-grain, cross-domain management of authorities and access controls must be embedded throughout the architecture.”\nZero-trust security, implemented correctly, is effective and prudent for current IT environments. Zero trust will become increasingly important in future 5G environments because of the radically expanding attack surface — via the increased number of connected nodes, commonly known as the Internet of Things — and the vast amount of data that will be exchanged over networks. Each node in the network will be a potential weak point, which is why identity and access management, access control via least privilege, and anomalous behavior detection will be critical elements to securing 5G-enabled IoT environments.

They are developing data analytics to define expected behavioral patterns, identify anomalies, and implement the zero-trust model. We look to data analytics to provide insight into network automation and orchestration, given the large amount of data that will traverse 5G networks and overwhelm network managers.”</p>\n<p>The ESF is a public-private partnership between the NSA, Defense Department, Department of Homeland Security (specifically, CISA), Intelligence Community, and companies within the US IT and defense industrial base sectors. The ESF’s charter is to address threats and risks to the security and stability of US national security systems and critical infrastructure, Noble noted.</p>\n\n<p>The guidance is one way NSA is “focusing our expertise in cryptography and cybersecurity to help industry and government to integrate security into all aspects of the 5G ecosystem,” Noble said in a keynote at <a href=\"https://dcevents.afceachapters.org/5GDefenseTechSummit?i=Vs24Fpm0GmdacjL8f6H9FDdNWrgNPRoc\">AFCEA DC’s 2021 5G Defense Tech Summit</a>. The guidance will be published on NSA’s website “sometime this spring,” Noble said.</p>\n<p>“The cumulative goal” of ESF’s work on 5G “is to jointly improve the ability of the 5G infrastructure to identify and build threat models, detect threats in networks, recover from attacks, and securely leverage the benefits of virtualization,” <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/Feature-Stories/Article-View/Article/2394999/nsa-secures-5g-through-partnerships/\">according</a> to NSA.</p>\n\n \n<p>Noble’s speech highlighted the importance of zero-trust architecture in 5G networks. The NSA recently <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/03/after-solarwinds-hack-nsa-pushes-zero-trust-model/\">urged the defense sector to adopt a zero-trust security model</a> in the wake of the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/solarwinds/\">SolarWinds cyberespionage campaign</a>. Given Noble’s emphasis today on zero-trust security models and supply chain risks — as well as the fact that the SolarWinds breach was on the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/cipac-cs-esf-ops-agenda-01-28-21-508.pdf\">agenda</a> for ESF’s January meeting — it’s reasonable to expect that future NSA 5G security recommendations will emphasize zero trust as a key component.</p>\n<p>NSA has <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2021/Feb/25/2002588479/-1/-1/0/CSI_EMBRACING_ZT_SECURITY_MODEL_UOO115131-21.PDF\">characterized</a> zero trust as “a security model, a set of system design principles, and a coordinated cybersecurity and system management strategy.” It’s a “data-center centric” approach to security, which assumes the worst — that an organization is already breached or will be breached. Based on “assumed breach,” zero-trust models apply the security principle of “least privilege” to every user and node in a network, enforced with risk-based access control, security monitoring, and security automation.</p>\n<p>Noble noted today, “The zero-trust model is predicated on encryption algorithms and key exchange processes that are quantum resistant. Likewise, fine-grain, cross-domain management of authorities and access controls must be embedded throughout the architecture.”</p>\n<p>Zero-trust security, implemented correctly, is effective and prudent for current IT environments. Zero trust will become increasingly important in future 5G environments because of the radically expanding attack surface — via the increased number of connected nodes, commonly known as the Internet of Things — and the vast amount of data that will be exchanged over networks. Each node in the network will be a potential weak point, which is why identity and access management, access control via least privilege, and anomalous behavior detection will be critical elements to securing 5G-enabled IoT environments. And 5G security will be further complicated by extensive decentralized (i.e., edge vs. cloud) computing and data storage, as well as the high degree of network automation.</p>\n<p>“High-speed networks will test our defenses,” Noble predicted.</p>\n<p>Noble also discussed supply chain risks, specifically mentioning the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/solarwinds/\">SolarWinds</a> breach, certain foreign countries, and some <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/fccs-carr-close-chinese-backdoors-into-us-networks/\">telecommunications equipment makers</a>.

But, multiple experts warn, the service still must convince Congress and the Biden Administration that a new heavily armed and armored infantry carrier –\nin many ways optimized for Eastern Europe\n– will be\nrelevant to the Pacific\n.\nEven within the Army, OMFV must compete against more obvious counter-China weapons like\nlong-range missiles\n,\nhigh-speed aircraft\nand\nair & missile defense\n. The Army’s budget as a whole is under pressure to fund more air and naval forces for the Pacific: No less a figure than former Army Chief of Staff and current Joint Chiefs Chairman,\nGen. Mark Milley, have warned of a budgetary “bloodletting” for the land service.\nDespite OMFV’s emphasis on\nelectronics and automation\n, it’s hard to sell\n$46 billion worth\nof\nnew ground combat vehicles\nas revolutionary tech when you’re competing with\narmed robots\n,\nhypersonic missiles\nand drone-killing\nlasers\n.\n“The budget situation [and] the ghosts of past failed Army acquisitions …do not bode well for the OMFV,” said\nAEI\n’s\nBill Greenwalt\n, a longtime skeptic of the Army’s acquisition bureaucracy. “Historically, large Army programs have been plagued by plans to incentivize the creation of items that are just slightly better than what is currently in inventory, take decades to get there, and then are ultimately cancelled or scaled back. OFMV is likely to head down this path without a major cultural shift.”\nThe Army’s current Infantry Fighting Vehicle, the M2 Bradley, was designed in the 1970s, entered production in 1980, and has been repeatedly upgraded since, to the point that the chassis, engine, and electrical system are getting overloaded. The Army has at least three cancelled programs they tried and failed to develop a replacement:\nthe\nFuture Combat Systems\n, awarded to Boeing and SAIC;\nthe Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), for which\nBAE Systems and General Dynamics competed\n;\nand the initial attempt at OMFV back in 2019,\nfor which General Dynamics was the only bidder\n.\nBy contrast, the\nrebooted OMFV program\n– with a\nmore realistic schedule\nand\nless stringent demands on industry\n– got at least five bids this month. The competing teams’ prime contractors include the usual suspects,\nBAE Systems\n(which makes the Bradley) and\nGeneral Dynamics\n(which makes the M1 Abrams), but also two foreign firms,\nGermany’s Rheinmetall\nand\nKorea’s Hanwha\n(teamed with Oshkosh), and even a small business,\nMichigan-based Mettle Ops\n.\nAdmittedly, the barriers to entry are much lower this time around: The current contenders are just submitting digital concepts, with physical prototypes not due until\na later phase of the program\nthat starts in 2023. And the Army can make up to five concept awards, meaning all five contenders can participate in this phase. But the Army can still take heart in how its new approach has gotten a more robust industry response than previous programs.\n“A year ago there was rightful skepticism of the OMFV’s future,” said\nGuy Swan\n, a former armor officer now with the\nAssociation of the US Army\n. “This program is now back on track, has solid leadership, and a realistic game plan – all of which is built on a strong Army-Industry partnership…. Now we need Congress to provide the resources to bring this program to reality for our soldiers.\n“Clearly, there are challenges ahead,” Swan acknowledged in an email interview. “But the fact that so many bidders have come forward for this second round of the OMFV program solicitation indicates that industry leaders feel some significant level of confidence in the program and the congressional support it will receive.”\nIn particular, Swan said, “the number of companies and their geographic locations ensures that Congress will take note of the number of jobs involved, especially during the post-COVID 19 economic recovery.” BAE’s vehicle factory is in Pennsylvania, GD’s in Ohio, Oshkosh’s in Wisconsin; Mettle Ops is in Michigan, although it would need to find a larger partner to actually build prototypes, while Rheinmetall is still picking a US location.\nBut are all these companies genuine contenders in the Army’s eyes?\n“The number of competitors is a positive,” agreed Greenwalt, “but one has to question whether the Army is\nreally\nserious about ever moving beyond its current industrial base, in this case BAE and GD…. Bidders beyond the ground systems duopoly may need to be highly suspicious as to whether the Army can break from its past record of awards.”\n“Hanwha, Rheinmetall and particularly MettleOps may eventually only be there for window dressing,” Greenwalt warned, “essentially serving the same function that\nKarem Aircraft\nand\nAVX\ndid on FARA.” That’s the\nFuture Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft\n, where the Army included small businesses in\nawards for early designs\nbut whittled it down to aerospace stalwarts\nBell\nand\nSikorsky\nfor actual prototypes.\nThe Hard Part\nEven if the Army manages the OMFV program well, it faces an uphill battle to sell the program.\n“While the additional offerors help the acquisition strategy, the fundamental problems of budget constraints and strategic focus on China make OMFV’s future challenging,”\nCSIS scholar\nMark Cancian\ntold me. “The program does not align well with a China and Pacific-focused strategy. Although OMFV is high in the Army priorities, it will have a hard time gaining traction with the strategists in OSD [the Office of the Secretary of Defense]. They will give priority to long-range strike capabilities.\n“The Army budget will be squeezed and there will be intense competition for modernization dollars,” Cancian said. “OMFV will need to compete with all [35] Army development programs and is not mature enough to have developed a broad coalition in Congress.”\nBut\nconvincing Congress\nisn’t the hard part here, argued\nTom Spoehr\n, a retired Army three-star now with the\nHeritage Foundation\n: It’s the Biden Administration appointees in OSD, especially the veterans of Obama-era cuts.\n“I think Congress would be willing to give the Army the benefit of the doubt and support the OMFV program, especially given the robust responses to the RFP [Request For Proposals],” Spoehr told me. “Armored vehicle production easily translates to manufacturing jobs – unlike AI or networks – which is always attractive to Congress.”\n“The bigger problem,” he went on, “[is] the Biden administration is bringing back many of the same people who were disposed to make cuts to the Army in the 2014 timeframe, and it will be an uphill battle to convince them that great power competition— including against China—is a global competition that\nwill not just be fought [in] the Western Pacific\n.”\n“In 2014, these new Biden nominees were of the opinion that if America declared that the Army would not be sized or equipped for stability operations, that the rest of the world would similarly agree not to challenge the U.S. in a way that required those type of forces and capabilities,” Spoehr snarked. “The world is never so forgiving.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: With <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/omfv-why-small-biz-mettleops-has-a-shot/\">at</a> <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/omfv-koreas-hanwha-is-officially-in/\">least</a> <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/omfv-gd-emphasizes-ai-adaptability-for-bradley-replacement/\">five</a> <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/omfv-army-gets-bae-bradley-replacement-design/\">industry</a> <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/l3harris-joins-rheinmetalls-team-lynx-for-army-omfv/\">teams</a> submitting proposals, the Army’s rebooted <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/omfv/\">Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle</a> program has passed one hurdle that doomed its predecessor: getting enough competitors.

{"title": "FVL: Don’t Pick The Tiltrotor, V-22 Test Pilot Tells Army", "publish_time": "2021-04-30 10:01:23", "author": ["Scott Trail"], "content": "Defiant-X compound helicopters sling-loading heavy cargo (artist’s conception)\nMost military veterans swear by the gear they’re familiar with. But in this op-ed, former Marine Corps V-22 test pilot Scott Trail says that while tiltrotors are a good fit for the Marine Corps’ long-range missions, a compound helicopter is a better match for the Army. Why? Read on! The Editors.\n\n\nWhich aircraft should the Army buy to replace the Reagan-era UH-60 Black Hawk? On March 30, the Army announced that Bell Textron’s V-280 Valor tiltrotor and the Sikorsky-Boeing Defiant X compound helicopter will advance to the next phase of the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program.\nBased on my research and my first-hand experience as a tiltrotor test pilot in the Marine Corps, the compound helicopter is the clear choice when it comes to choosing the configuration that best supports the Army’s mission and minimizes costs.\n\n\nWhile tiltrotors offer superior high-altitude cruise performance, that’s less relevant to future high-intensity warfare where Army aircraft will have to stay low to avoid advanced anti-aircraft defenses. Also ,the compound helicopter is more agile at low altitude, hovers better at high altitudes in hot weather, and can maintain tighter formations. More importantly, the training and military construction costs to switch from the H-60 to a compound helicopter will be much lower than the transition costs for a tiltrotor.\nSikorsky-Boeing SB>1 Defiant compound helicopter (left) and Bell Textron V-280 Valor tiltrotor (right)\nThe Mission\n\n\n \n\nKey characteristics of the long-range assault mission are the ability to fly fast at altitudes below 200 feet, then mass on the objective to deliver combat power. Landing on the objective quickly is critical to maintain the element of surprise and overwhelm enemy forces.\nThe Marines already have a long-range assault platform in the V-22 tiltrotor. You could reason that the Army may follow the Marine Corps’ decision and leverage their tiltrotor experience. However, the Marines and the Army have different missions. The tiltrotor configuration is in line with the Marine’s vision statement to, “fight and win our nation’s battles… respond quickly to the complex spectrum of crises and conflicts, and gain access or prosecute forcible entry operations.” (emphasis added) Winning battles, responding to crises and prosecuting forcible entry requires an aircraft that flies far and fast, especially in the vast Pacific.\nThe Army’s FLRAA supports a different mission. The Army’s mission is: “To…win our nation’s wars… indefinitely seizing and controlling those things the adversary needs most…” (emphasis added) Winning wars and indefinitely seizing and controlling resources requires the ability to rapidly buildup combat forces and sustain operations, where tight formations and hover performance are critical capabilities. It is in these areas that the compound helicopter excels.\nBoth of these missions will be required to prevail in the Asia-Pacific region.\nArriving Undetected\nTo avoid China’s sophisticated air defenses, assault aircraft must fly low to avoid detection. Flying low prevents the V-280 from cruising at high altitude and decreases its advantage in fuel consumption over the Defiant X compound helicopter. In airplane mode, the low acoustic signature of the V-280 is an advantage. But, as the tiltrotor transitions for landing, it is “loud as hell” according to a report by The War Zone. And historically, the way ground troops get warning of incoming helicopters is by hearing them – which means louder aircraft give the enemy more time to prepare and even shoot them down.\nRapid Build Up of Combat Power\nThe speed and range of both the V-280 and the Defiant X is transformational. However, rapid buildup of combat power is not simply achieved through speed. It is achieved by flying tight formations and landing in confined landing zones.\nAccording to the 101st Airborne, H-60 helicopters can land safely with just 30 meters (98 feet) of separation. By comparison, the V-22 requires 76m (250ft) separation, two-and-a-half times more than the H-60.\nThis increased spacing is not an arbitrary requirement. In June of 2012, the Air Force crashed a Special Operations CV-22 , which was caused by the trailing CV-22 flying through the rotorwash of the lead aircraft. While the V-280 will likely require less separation than the V-22, tiltrotor formation separation will be significantly greater than the Defiant X compound helicopter. Importantly, increased separation also increases the number of flights required to build combat power, which increases exposure to enemy fire, especially during the initial landings when soldiers are most vulnerable.\nSustained Operations\nOnce rapid buildup of combat forces is complete, the Army’s mission turns to sustaining operations. This phase places an emphasis on hover performance and vertical maneuver in rugged terrain. With its larger, coaxial rotor, the Defiant X’s hover efficiency and performance exceeds the V-280’s, especially under high, hot conditions. The Defiant X will carry more and have increased power margins at altitude compared to the V-280.\nLife Cycle Cost\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that between 450 to 900 FLRAA could be purchased at a cost of $23.8-$47.6 billion. It is likely the Army will need more FLRAA to replace the current H-60 fleet of 2,279 helicopters. With this number of new aircraft required, even a relatively small sustainment cost increase on a per aircraft basis will result in substantially increased budget requirements. According to Defense Acquisition University, 72 percent of life-cycle costs are incurred during the sustainment phase of acquisition. To ensure a successful program, such costs must be weighed heavily, and the costs to transition from the H-60 to one of the two FLRAA options will likely be dramatically different. The best way to limit that “switching cost” is to choose a configuration that is most similar to the H-60’s training and infrastructure needs.\nTraining\nDue to the unique flying characteristics of the V-280, the Army will need to train its pilots to fly three different aircraft: the way the Marines train V-22 pilots today: first a helicopter, then a fixed-wing airplane, and only then a tiltrotor.). On this model, in addition to the 32 weeks of Army helicopter instruction, tiltrotor pilots will require 20 weeks of multi-engine training and 20 weeks of simulator and in-flight tiltrotor training, almost a year-and-a-half of training to fly the tiltrotor. This training burden requires additional aircraft, instructors, infrastructure, and military construction. While compound specific training will be required, it will certainly be less than tiltrotor training and will negate the need for multi-engine training.\nMilitary Construction\nSince the Defiant X’s rotor diameter is similar to the H-60’s 53’ 8” rotor, the same ramp space and existing hangar space accommodates the Defiant X aircraft, thus avoiding any new military construction costs. In contrast, the Valor is 81.8 ft wide, 45 percent wider than the Defiant X. That increase in width requires wider hangars and larger ramps, which would mean increased military construction costs. A unit of six V-280s requires expanding the ramp and hangar by approximately 150 feet. Multiplied across 900 tiltrotor FLRAAs, it would mean more than four miles of extensions to ramp and hangar space.\nConclusion\nIn this competition, the tiltrotor wins for speed and range. For rapid buildup of combat power and sustaining operations, the compound helicopter’s hover performance and tight formations provide a clear advantage. When it comes to the configuration that best supports the Army’s mission while minimizing life cycle costs, the Defiant X performs best where it matters most.\nScott Trail is a retired Marine CH-46E helicopter pilot, V-22 developmental test pilot, and a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots.

That system will be fielded sometime in the last quarter of fiscal year 2022, according to an email from a service spokesperson.\nThe email was in response to questions put to the service\nalmost two months ago\n, which we finally received Friday — simultaneously with the Air Force\npress release officially marking the ABMS “transition”\nto a full-fledged acquisition program.\nFurther, the service also has created a new Cross Functional Team (CFT), led by Brig. Gen. Jeffery Valenzia to establish ABMS “manpower, resources and doctrinal infrastructure,” the press release said. Valenzia, an Air Force official told us, sits on the service’s J5 plans and program staff and has been sitting on the Joint Staff’s CFT for development of the\nJoint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2)\nstrategy. ABMS is being designed by the service to serve as its C2 underpinning for JADC2 — with the new strategy expected to be released by\nDoD by the end of next month.\nThe Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), which\nwas charged last year to take on ABMS as a program of record,\nalso has jettisoned the Silicon Valley-esque construct and naming convention instituted by former service acquisition head Will Roper. So no more\n“on-ramp” demonstrations,\nno more “products,” no more cool new software/gadgets with the suffix ‘ONE.’\n“ABMS has pivoted away from the identification of capabilities by their legacy ‘ONE” product monikers’,” the Air Force spokesperson wrote.

Each package will require the joint approval of Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown and Chief of Space Operations Gen. Jay Raymond, the spokesperson said.\nBut RCO has developed a matrix of capabilities it intends to deliver under ABMS, the spokesperson wrote:\nSecure Processing: Provide hybrid commercial and edge multi-cloud environments and edge devices for secure processing, data management, and applications at all security levels.\nConnectivity: Provide agile communications, connectivity, and mesh networking between sensors, decision nodes, and mission effects to support mission execution, including under degraded conditions.\nData Management: Provide a data architecture across the network for data across all domains and from multiple sensor types at multiple security levels so static and streaming data are properly characterized, available, and discoverable.\nApplications: Provide applications, leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, to enable data processing, data fusion, all-domain operating pictures, and machine-to-machine command and control.\nSensor Integration: Integrate sensors into a network to enable publishing of real time and static data for joint all-domain missions.\nEffects Integration: Integrate kinetic and non-kinetic effects using machine-to-machine command and control.\nThe service spokesperson explained that RCO will use “a range” of contracting types, “tailored to the capability being delivered.” These include “Multiple Award ID/IQ, Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs), Other Transactions, Small Business Innovative Research (SIBR) Phase III, existing contracts, and Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs),” the email stated.\nMeanwhile, Preston Dunlap’s Chief Architect Office will continue to undertake ABMS-related experiments — now called “Architecture Demonstration and Evaluation (ADE) events,” according to the spokesperson. Dunlap’s office and RCO “will coordinate to ensure unity of effort and will work to integrate ABMS capabilities inclusion in future DAF Architecture Demonstration and Evaluation events,” the spokesperson wrote.\nWhether those demonstrations continue on their earlier four-month cycle, however, is up in the air. Because of\nthe massive chop Congress took out of the ABMS budget request for 2021\n, the Air Force\ncould only undertake two of three\nplanned demonstrations.\nRCO also had to push back actual investment in the new KC-46 comms pod from this year until fiscal year 2022.\nThe service received $170 million for ABMS this fiscal year, and intends to keep spending on improvements over the next five years.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-130340\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/ABMS_DVIDS_1000w_q95e.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/ABMS_DVIDS_1000w_q95e.jpg 1000w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/ABMS_DVIDS_1000w_q95e-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/ABMS_DVIDS_1000w_q95e-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/ABMS_DVIDS_1000w_q95e-210x140.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"/>WASHINGTON: The Air Force has overhauled the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/advanced-battle-management-system/\">Advanced Battle Management System</a> program to better integrate it into the service’s traditional acquisition structure — and will field the first ABMS gear next year.</p>\n<p>The changes were made to move the program away from its past focus on rapid tech experimentation and development to a more traditional emphasis on fielding operational capabilities, one Air Force official explained.</p>\n<p>The first “package” of ABMS capabilities to be fielded will be<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/03/amc-eyes-self-defense-for-cargo-tanker-planes/\"> a new pod-based communications system for the KC-46, enabling the tanker</a> to serve as a kind of flying cell tower between the incompatible radio systems of the F-22 and F-35 fighters.

{"title": "DoD Publishes DevSecOps 2.0 Docs For Accelerating Apps", "publish_time": "2021-05-17 21:42:55", "author": ["Brad D. Williams"], "content": "WASHINGTON: In just three years, the Department of Defense has made significant progress in creating a secure software development operations environment, or\nDevSecOps\n, to make better code faster. As part of these ongoing efforts, the Pentagon has released a batch of Enterprise DevSecOps v2.0 documents — and one of the leaders behind that initiative has just started working with the Joint Staff J6 on making DevSecOps resources available to\nJoint All Domain Command and Control\n.\nJADC2, as it’s called, is the future interservice meta-network to link forces across land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. It’s such a daunting technical challenge that traditional federal procurement processes can’t develop it fast enough — but DevSecOps could.\n“DevSecOps is the foundation of the success of JADC2,” said\nNicolas Chaillan\n, the Air Force’s chief software officer, in an interview with\nBreaking Defense\n. “Without DevSecOps, you won’t be able to move at the pace” needed, Chaillan told me.\nWhat’s In a Name?\nDevOps combines software development and IT operations for the rapid creation and use of apps, with developers and users working side by side to test new software, find improvements, and quickly push out upgrades. DevSecOps brings in cybersecurity experts and practices to DevOps. In DoD’s case, this entails implementing\nzero-trust security\nin the DevSecOps environment. Talking to Chaillan for just a few minutes reveals his focus on security, with zero trust frequently mentioned.\nAlso underlying DoD’s DevSecOps is a software development framework called\nAgile\n, which enables teams to continuously improve and rapidly update the underlying code for apps.\nThe\nnew DevSecOps 2.0 docs\ninclude:\nA fundamentals guide\nA strategy guide\nTools and activities guide\nA playbook\nA reference guide for Cloud Native Computing Foundation Kubernetes, a cloud technology used for automating tasks, getting apps into the cloud (e.g., to servers), and underlying cloud operations.\nFrom Early Skepticism at DoD to Building a Thriving Community\nChaillan joined DoD after years in the private sector, where he founded 12 companies and also created and sold 190 software products. Beginning at 14, Chaillan became a pioneer of and early contributor to PHP, which has become a widely used programming language for web servers. His background includes software and cybersecurity. “The two go together,” he says, but “at the same time, it’s about the right balance” between the speed of software development and security.\nHe was initially tapped in 2018 to co-lead, with the DoD CIO, the initiative to bring DevSecOps to the DoD enterprise. A great deal of his time has been spent “breaking silos” to enable collaboration, Chaillan says. He was surprised when some people told him early on he was “wasting his time” on these efforts — but he hasn’t quit.\nThe result? Today, there are more than 200 teams implementing DevSecOps across the Defense Department, Chaillan tells me, with 650 software containers.\nWhat’s a container? In layperson’s terms, it’s a way to package software so it can be run in the cloud.\nA container can hold multiple apps, and containerized apps can be deployed on a variety of servers without time-consuming reconfiguration for each one. This simplifies and speeds up the process of getting software to users. It also helps avoid getting “locked in” with a single cloud provider or platform. Containers enable software developers to focus on building apps and the IT team to focus on infrastructure (e.g., servers that host apps), deployment (getting apps into the cloud so people can use them), scaling the needed resources to run apps, and other operations.\nContainers are critical to Chaillan’s focus on avoiding so-called “lock in” to a single provider or platform. “This was important,” Chaillan says, “because we wanted to give teams options, while at the same time make sure we’re not building software in a vacuum and that we can reuse software across DoD programs.”\nChaillan describes the approach as the “Lego block concept,” in which teams can share containers among themselves and other teams. This more modular, adaptive, and flexible approach to software, in which a high percentage of code can be shared, contrasts with the software for the F-35, where Chaillan notes only five percent is shared between platforms today.\n“It’s very important to us that we do better than that,” Chaillan says. “We don’t want to get locked in, whether a DevSecOps or cloud platform,” referring to\nPlatform One\nand\nCloud One,\nrespectively.\nNow, Chaillan says, “We have some of the largest DoD programs on [Platform One].” He says the apps currently entail “a little of everything.” However, he adds, “When I started, I wanted to focus on the war mission, well, because that’s why we’re here. I wanted to demonstrate it’s possible on weapons systems, because if you can do it on weapons systems, you can pretty much do it anywhere. So, we wanted to show the hardest use case first.”\nThat included F-16 software, which took just 45 days in 2019 to move into the DevSecOps environment. “That was a big win, just showing we can do that on the jet that is 40 years old, using legacy software.” It expanded from there to include the F-35 and B-21, among others, as well as code for the Navy’s\nAEGIS\nand code being developed by the Pentagon’s\nJoint Artificial Intelligence Center\n.\nSo far, Platform One has saved, on average, a year and $12.5 million per app it’s been used to launch, according to Chaillan. That adds up across the volume of apps DoD expects to develop going forward.\nThere are two options: The Party Bus, which is a multi-tenant cloud environment, and Big Bang, which enables people to take Platform One code to be deployed anywhere — on premise or in the cloud across classification levels, as well as at the edge on jets and bombers, for instance.\n“It’s been a big enabler,” Chaillan observes. “It allows teams to move to DevSecOps on Day 1 instead of having to spend a year to build [all the prerequisites]. This is a living, breathing organism, if you will, and DevSecOps moves very fast, and that’s part of the challenge.”\nAnother challenge is training people in DevSecOps. So Chaillan and his team created a\nself-guided curriculum\nfor would-be users. The goal this year, Chaillan says, is to train 100,000 people in DevSecOps.\nDespite the initial success, Chaillan says, “I still struggle with silos, but once you get going, people tend to jump on the train.”\nAnd the success started relatively early for Chaillan and his team. The 1.0 DevSecOps doc, which took about four months to develop and eight months to be approved, focused on building blocks like zero-trust security, behavior detection, continuous monitoring, and\nKubernetes.\nUpon release of the 1.0 doc, Chaillan says it got 500,000 views on LinkedIn alone. “It was pretty amazing,” Chaillan reflects. “Clearly, a lot of people paid attention to it.”\nChaillan says the response was important because his goal has been to build a “very strong public community of practice around DevSecOps.” To do this, he’s created partnerships across the DoD services, federal agencies, the Intelligence Community, and private companies — including about 100 startups. That community of practice has grown to about 1,500 people sharing information and collaborating.\nThe Automation Effect\nDoD’s DevSecOps entails a significant amount of automation, from security to testing. Chaillan says there are “so many pieces that will benefit” from automation. In the case of Platform One, it now releases 31 times a day, which “isn’t Facebook, but it’s pretty good,” Chaillan jokes.\nWith DevSecOps automation, DoD can “effectively save between 12 to 18 months per program for every five-year cycle of planned time, just by automating” a single process around continuous authority to operate. In addition, DevSecOps condenses the timeline between getting feedback from the warfighters using the software and the development team’s ability to push small, incremental improvements faster. Chaillan says this process can save, on average, six to eight months. So far, Chaillan says, DoD has saved 100 years of planned time by moving these apps into the DevSecOps environment.\n“That’s 100 years of planned time that was going to be spent — well, I guess wasted — without that automation,” Chaillan observes. “The fact is, no one is waiting for us to figure this out. Other nations are also rapidly adopting DevOps, so it’s important for us to automate as much as we can.”\nThe goal is to get DoD to a place where someone can “push a button [and] deploy anywhere” — to the edge, in the cloud, on premise, Chaillan says.\nBringing DevSecOps to JADC2\nChaillan recently announced that, in addition to his current Air Force CSO position, he will be working part time on JADC2 with\nLt. Gen. Dennis Crall,\nthe director for Command, Control, Communications, and Computers / Cyber and chief information officer, Joint Staff J6. The J6 has been charged with leading the JADC2 effort.\n“The goal is to bring all the great work we’ve done with all these programs and help with the adoption of Platform One in JADC2 as an enterprise service that will be available for teams.” This will include all the component pieces already in place, such as DevSecOps, identity management, and, of course, zero-trust security. “You can’t just connect things and hope for the best,” Chaillan observes. “You have to have that zero-trust enforcement.”\nThe first step will be to assess where the DoD is in regards to the J6 roadmap for introducing enterprise services into JADC2. “A lot of it is still being discussed,” Chaillan says. “I just started [working on JADC2] two weeks ago. But the vision is to sit down with all the services and collaborate and bring some of these centralized options to enable teams to move faster.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-151661\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/dod-it-automation-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/dod-it-automation-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/dod-it-automation-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/dod-it-automation-768x432.jpg 768w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/dod-it-automation-210x118.jpg 210w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/dod-it-automation.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"/></p>\n<p>WASHINGTON: In just three years, the Department of Defense has made significant progress in creating a secure software development operations environment, or <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/dod-enterprise-devsecops-initiative/\">DevSecOps</a>, to make better code faster. As part of these ongoing efforts, the Pentagon has released a batch of Enterprise DevSecOps v2.0 documents — and one of the leaders behind that initiative has just started working with the Joint Staff J6 on making DevSecOps resources available to <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/jadc2/\">Joint All Domain Command and Control</a>.</p>\n<p>JADC2, as it’s called, is the future interservice meta-network to link forces across land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. It’s such a daunting technical challenge that traditional federal procurement processes can’t develop it fast enough — but DevSecOps could.</p>\n<p>“DevSecOps is the foundation of the success of JADC2,” said <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/air-force-chief-software-officer-nicolas-chaillan/\">Nicolas Chaillan</a>, the Air Force’s chief software officer, in an interview with <em>Breaking Defense</em>. “Without DevSecOps, you won’t be able to move at the pace” needed, Chaillan told me.</p>\n<p>What’s In a Name?</p>\n<p>DevOps combines software development and IT operations for the rapid creation and use of apps, with developers and users working side by side to test new software, find improvements, and quickly push out upgrades. DevSecOps brings in cybersecurity experts and practices to DevOps. In DoD’s case, this entails implementing <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/zero-trust/\">zero-trust security</a> in the DevSecOps environment. Talking to Chaillan for just a few minutes reveals his focus on security, with zero trust frequently mentioned.</p>\n<p>Also underlying DoD’s DevSecOps is a software development framework called <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/agile-software-development/\">Agile</a>, which enables teams to continuously improve and rapidly update the underlying code for apps.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://software.af.mil/dsop/documents/\">new DevSecOps 2.0 docs</a> include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A fundamentals guide</li>\n<li>A strategy guide</li>\n<li>Tools and activities guide</li>\n<li>A playbook</li>\n<li>A reference guide for Cloud Native Computing Foundation Kubernetes, a cloud technology used for automating tasks, getting apps into the cloud (e.g., to servers), and underlying cloud operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Early Skepticism at DoD to Building a Thriving Community</p>\n<p>Chaillan joined DoD after years in the private sector, where he founded 12 companies and also created and sold 190 software products. Beginning at 14, Chaillan became a pioneer of and early contributor to PHP, which has become a widely used programming language for web servers. His background includes software and cybersecurity. “The two go together,” he says, but “at the same time, it’s about the right balance” between the speed of software development and security.</p>\n<p>He was initially tapped in 2018 to co-lead, with the DoD CIO, the initiative to bring DevSecOps to the DoD enterprise. A great deal of his time has been spent “breaking silos” to enable collaboration, Chaillan says. He was surprised when some people told him early on he was “wasting his time” on these efforts — but he hasn’t quit.</p>\n<p>The result? Today, there are more than 200 teams implementing DevSecOps across the Defense Department, Chaillan tells me, with 650 software containers.</p>\n<p>What’s a container? In layperson’s terms, it’s a way to package software so it can be run in the cloud.<b> </b>A container can hold multiple apps, and containerized apps can be deployed on a variety of servers without time-consuming reconfiguration for each one. This simplifies and speeds up the process of getting software to users. It also helps avoid getting “locked in” with a single cloud provider or platform. Containers enable software developers to focus on building apps and the IT team to focus on infrastructure (e.g., servers that host apps), deployment (getting apps into the cloud so people can use them), scaling the needed resources to run apps, and other operations.</p>\n<p>Containers are critical to Chaillan’s focus on avoiding so-called “lock in” to a single provider or platform. “This was important,” Chaillan says, “because we wanted to give teams options, while at the same time make sure we’re not building software in a vacuum and that we can reuse software across DoD programs.”</p>\n<p>Chaillan describes the approach as the “Lego block concept,” in which teams can share containers among themselves and other teams. This more modular, adaptive, and flexible approach to software, in which a high percentage of code can be shared, contrasts with the software for the F-35, where Chaillan notes only five percent is shared between platforms today.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important to us that we do better than that,” Chaillan says. “We don’t want to get locked in, whether a DevSecOps or cloud platform,” referring to <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/platformone/\">Platform One</a> and <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/cloudone/\">Cloud One,</a> respectively.</p>\n<p>Now, Chaillan says, “We have some of the largest DoD programs on [Platform One].” He says the apps currently entail “a little of everything.” However, he adds, “When I started, I wanted to focus on the war mission, well, because that’s why we’re here. I wanted to demonstrate it’s possible on weapons systems, because if you can do it on weapons systems, you can pretty much do it anywhere. So, we wanted to show the hardest use case first.”</p>\n<p>That included F-16 software, which took just 45 days in 2019 to move into the DevSecOps environment. “That was a big win, just showing we can do that on the jet that is 40 years old, using legacy software.” It expanded from there to include the F-35 and B-21, among others, as well as code for the Navy’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/aegis/\">AEGIS</a> and code being developed by the Pentagon’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/jaic/\">Joint Artificial Intelligence Center</a>.</p>\n<p>So far, Platform One has saved, on average, a year and $12.5 million per app it’s been used to launch, according to Chaillan.

{"title": "Fleet Decentralization Focus For AF Budget Beyond 2023", "publish_time": "2021-05-14 20:59:23", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: A key Air Force focus for the 2023-2027 budget will be “agile combat employment,” and the problem of contested logistics in globalized warfare, says Lt. Gen. David Nahom, service deputy chief of staff for plans and programs.\n“As we look forward in our investment, you’re gonna hear us spend a lot of time on we’re calling\n‘agile combat employment,’ or ACE:\nthe ability to operate away from establish runways, operate in a manner that makes difficult problems for our adversaries.”\nBut it’s unclear what ACE will mean as far as equipment and future spending, because the Air Force has yet to fully flesh out the new operational concept for fighting globalized war with Russia and/or China — with Beijing in particular moving to beef up its missile inventories and other capabilities for power projection.\n“We’re just now getting after the concepts of what ‘agile combat employment’ means, and the types of things we’re going to need to ensure that we can operate away from established areas,” Nahom told the annual McAleese conference yesterday. “I think we’re gonna have to have a lot of conversations going into the ’23 cycle.”\nAir Force leaders\nhave described ACE as predicated on a ‘hub and spoke’ network of permanent, well-established ‘hubs’ and more remote, austere ‘spokes.’ But that framework idea is based on a number of different, but inter-related, subcomponents.\n“Critical infrastructure defense — based defense in other words. How do we defend what we have out there?” Nahom elaborated. “And, certainly, you’ll hear a lot about logistics under attack. Moving logistics will be very difficult in the future, and we’re going to have to make sure that we have the ability to move not just to establish runways, but to small runways and places that may not even have runways.”\nThe concept is an evolution of what former Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldfein called “agile basing” in his\nJoint All Domain Operations doctrine\npaper — and something he made one of his top priorities for future investment.\nIt has also become one of the four critical supporting concepts, under the term “contested logistics,” for the impending\nJoint Warfighting Concept (JWC)\ndesigned to lay out how the services will work together to enable all-domain operations. And as such, the question of who is responsible for protecting vulnerable bases against everything from adversary missile strikes to small drone attacks to infiltration by enemy soldiers has emerged as a\nroles and missions squabble between the Air Force and the Army.\nACE will require high-speed, highly protected communications networks — meaning it’s success will be highly dependent on the service’s\nAdvanced Battle Management System (ABMS)\nand DoD’s overarching\nJoint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2)\nstrategy.\nNahom said that the Air Force is “starting off small” to both invest and experiment in how to make ACE work. The issues require further “conversations,” he explained, both internally and externally with industry partners to make sure that “we’re getting what we need at the speed we need.”\nWith regards to exercises and experiments, he mentioned the\nRapid Forge\nexercise in Europe in 2019; but there have been more recent exercises as well. These include the September 2020\nValiant Shield\njoint forces exercise in the Pacific; the\nmultinational Cope North\nexercise in January that focused on the use of austere airfields; and an\nAir Force-only exercise April 27-30 at Mt. Hill AFB in Idaho\ntesting the ability of airmen to fly into a remote location, download gear from C-17 and then rapidly upload it to enable F-35 Lighting II fighters to scramble.\nInvestment, Nahom said is “relatively small” so far, but is “going to grow, because frankly, it has to.”\nWhile he did no specify where dollars are being spent, one high profile effort has been the\nAgility Prime\nprogram to develop “flying cars” that can take off and land vertically — a brainchild of former Air Force acquisition czar Will Roper.\nAir Force Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown told the McAleese conference on Wednesday that the service is looking at “what it’s going to take” to be able to implement ACE, including “what are the other future capabilities” needed.\nHe mentioned Agility Prime as one example, noting that it could provide “vertical lift that can be automated and doesn’t require a C-130.” Discussions also are underway about the future role of the C-17, he said — which despite its large size can land on austere runways, but is getting long in the tooth.\nAnother issue to be resolved is “how we pre-position capability,” Brown noted. “If we have a conflict with long lines of communication, we may not have enough time to build up the force like we’ve done in the past. And so my having capability prepositioned in certain areas will be important to us as well,” he said. “These are all conversations that are ongoing.”\nWhile Brown didn’t directly link the two, the ACE ‘conversation’ also is directly linked to what combat aircraft will comprise the future fleet — i.e., the airframe range, types of weapons (and their ranges/numbers per plane), stealth, self-defense capabilities, electronic warfare suites, etc.\nAnd this in turn relates directly to the future of the\nF-22 Raptor,\nwhich\nBrown on Wednesday conspicuously left off his list of four combat aircraft envisioned for the fleet\nbeyond 2030.\nAs\ncolleague Valeria Insinna first reported,\nthe service now sees the stealthy air-to-air fighter as inadequate for operations in the Indo-Pacific theater, primarily because of its short range (1,850 nautical miles), and its relatively small weapons carrying capacity. However, the Air Force has stressed that retirement of F-22 will depend on when a sixth-generation fighter, being developed under the\nNext Generation Air Dominance (NGAD)\nprogram, is ready to take over.\nAs for NGAD, Teal Group’s Richard Aboulafia cautioned that: “Expectations for systems maturation are typically overstated, often greatly so. If it isn’t ready, it doesn’t seem likely that the Air Force would be willing to lose that air-to-air capability … It would represent an unacceptable gap.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: A key Air Force focus for the 2023-2027 budget will be “agile combat employment,” and the problem of contested logistics in globalized warfare, says Lt.

David Nahom, service deputy chief of staff for plans and programs.</p>\n<p>“As we look forward in our investment, you’re gonna hear us spend a lot of time on we’re calling <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/agile-combat-employment/\">‘agile combat employment,’ or ACE:</a> the ability to operate away from establish runways, operate in a manner that makes difficult problems for our adversaries.”</p>\n<p>But it’s unclear what ACE will mean as far as equipment and future spending, because the Air Force has yet to fully flesh out the new operational concept for fighting globalized war with Russia and/or China — with Beijing in particular moving to beef up its missile inventories and other capabilities for power projection.</p>\n\n<p>“We’re just now getting after the concepts of what ‘agile combat employment’ means, and the types of things we’re going to need to ensure that we can operate away from established areas,” Nahom told the annual McAleese conference yesterday. “I think we’re gonna have to have a lot of conversations going into the ’23 cycle.”</p>\n<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/01/trilateral-cope-north-exercise-to-test-agile-air-ops-on-austere-airfields/\">Air Force leaders </a>have described ACE as predicated on a ‘hub and spoke’ network of permanent, well-established ‘hubs’ and more remote, austere ‘spokes.’ But that framework idea is based on a number of different, but inter-related, subcomponents.\n<p>“Critical infrastructure defense — based defense in other words. How do we defend what we have out there?” Nahom elaborated. “And, certainly, you’ll hear a lot about logistics under attack. Moving logistics will be very difficult in the future, and we’re going to have to make sure that we have the ability to move not just to establish runways, but to small runways and places that may not even have runways.”</p>\n<p>The concept is an evolution of what former Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldfein called “agile basing” in his <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/03/gen-goldfein-launches-air-force-doctrine-for-joint-all-domain-ops/\">Joint All Domain Operations doctrine</a> paper — and something he made one of his top priorities for future investment.</p>\n<p>It has also become one of the four critical supporting concepts, under the term “contested logistics,” for the impending <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/03/gen-goldfein-launches-air-force-doctrine-for-joint-all-domain-ops/\">Joint Warfighting Concept (JWC)</a> designed to lay out how the services will work together to enable all-domain operations. And as such, the question of who is responsible for protecting vulnerable bases against everything from adversary missile strikes to small drone attacks to infiltration by enemy soldiers has emerged as a <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/12/air-force-to-army-navy-pay-the-tax-for-space-air-power-protect-our-bases/\">roles and missions squabble between the Air Force and the Army.</a></p>\n<p>ACE will require high-speed, highly protected communications networks — meaning it’s success will be highly dependent on the service’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/advanced-battle-management-system/\">Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS)</a> and DoD’s overarching <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/joint-all-domain-command-and-control/\">Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2)</a> strategy.</p>\n<p>Nahom said that the Air Force is “starting off small” to both invest and experiment in how to make ACE work. The issues require further “conversations,” he explained, both internally and externally with industry partners to make sure that “we’re getting what we need at the speed we need.”</p>\n<p>With regards to exercises and experiments, he mentioned the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/09/target-kaliningrad-eucom-puts-putin-on-notice/\">Rapid Forge</a> exercise in Europe in 2019; but there have been more recent exercises as well. These include the September 2020 <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/10/first-joint-exercise-to-test-all-domain-capabilities-valiant-shield/\">Valiant Shield</a> joint forces exercise in the Pacific; the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/01/trilateral-cope-north-exercise-to-test-agile-air-ops-on-austere-airfields/\">multinational Cope North</a> exercise in January that focused on the use of austere airfields; and an <a href=\"https://www.hill.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2598683/34th-fighter-generation-squadron-completes-agile-combat-employment-exercise/\">Air Force-only exercise April 27-30 at Mt. Hill AFB in Idaho</a> testing the ability of airmen to fly into a remote location, download gear from C-17 and then rapidly upload it to enable F-35 Lighting II fighters to scramble.</p>\n<p>Investment, Nahom said is “relatively small” so far, but is “going to grow, because frankly, it has to.”</p>\n<p>While he did no specify where dollars are being spent, one high profile effort has been the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/agility-prime/\">Agility Prime</a> program to develop “flying cars” that can take off and land vertically — a brainchild of former Air Force acquisition czar Will Roper.</p>\n<p>Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown told the McAleese conference on Wednesday that the service is looking at “what it’s going to take” to be able to implement ACE, including “what are the other future capabilities” needed.</p>\n<p>He mentioned Agility Prime as one example, noting that it could provide “vertical lift that can be automated and doesn’t require a C-130.” Discussions also are underway about the future role of the C-17, he said — which despite its large size can land on austere runways, but is getting long in the tooth.</p>\n<p>Another issue to be resolved is “how we pre-position capability,” Brown noted. “If we have a conflict with long lines of communication, we may not have enough time to build up the force like we’ve done in the past. And so my having capability prepositioned in certain areas will be important to us as well,” he said. “These are all conversations that are ongoing.”</p>\n<p>While Brown didn’t directly link the two, the ACE ‘conversation’ also is directly linked to what combat aircraft will comprise the future fleet — i.e., the airframe range, types of weapons (and their ranges/numbers per plane), stealth, self-defense capabilities, electronic warfare suites, etc.</p>\n<p>And this in turn relates directly to the future of the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/f-22/\">F-22 Raptor,</a> which <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/05/air-force-may-tilt-to-drones-csaf-brown/\">Brown on Wednesday conspicuously left off his list of four combat aircraft envisioned for the fleet</a> beyond 2030.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/05/13/the-f-22-is-going-away-eventually-but-not-before-the-air-force-gets-comfortable-with-its-successor/\">colleague Valeria Insinna first reported,</a> the service now sees the stealthy air-to-air fighter as inadequate for operations in the Indo-Pacific theater, primarily because of its short range (1,850 nautical miles), and its relatively small weapons carrying capacity. However, the Air Force has stressed that retirement of F-22 will depend on when a sixth-generation fighter, being developed under the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/next-generation-air-dominance/\">Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD)</a> program, is ready to take over.</p>\n<p>As for NGAD, Teal Group’s Richard Aboulafia cautioned that: “Expectations for systems maturation are typically overstated, often greatly so. If it isn’t ready, it doesn’t seem likely that the Air Force would be willing to lose that air-to-air capability … It would represent an unacceptable gap.”</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["Advanced Battle Management System", "Agile Combat Employment", "Agility Prime", "air force", "All Domain Operations", "contested logistics", "Cope North", "Defense Budget 2021", "f-22", "Gen.

Timothy Ray says.\nIn a wide ranging interview with Mitchell Institute Dean David Deptula today, Ray also revealed that the\nAir-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW)\nhypersonic missile being developed for the conventional bomber fleet will undertake another flight test next month, after failing the first flight test of its booster in April.\nB-21: Fast Forward\nAs one example of how the new approach is speeding B-21 development, Ray told the Mitchell Institute today he expects integrating the\nAGM-158/B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile\n— Extended Range (JASSM-ER) onto the B-21 will be a breeze compared to what it took to fit the B-2 with the ground attack cruise missile.\n“I think it will take me about one tenth of the time to put the\nJASSM-ER\non the B-21 than it did the B-2. A tenth of the time,” he said, with obvious pride. Ray noted that the program\nhas been praised by Adam Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,\nwho is notorious for his sometimes scathing criticism of weapon systems suffering cost/schedule overruns, such as the\nF-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\nOne key factor in this success is the fact that\nAir Force Global Strike Command\nhas been in essence granted pre-approval to integrate new subsystems, so it doesn’t need to go back through the Pentagon’s complex requirements process each time, Ray explained.\n“The Joint Requirements Oversight Council has agreed that we don’t need to come back to ask for a new radio, or new weapon or new sensor, or new defensive system — it’s part of the bomber,” Ray said.\nThe other enabler is the\ndigital design and engineering approach being used by the service and prime contractor Northrop Grumman\n— an approach that as Ray noted also is being taken with development of the\nGround Based Strategic Deterrent\n.\n“And because of the way we built it and are building it … you can move very quickly. And so because you can move very quickly by adding a new radio or new weapon system, you don’t have to do that\nbefore\nyour IOC,” he said.\nThis will in turn, eliminate the need for massive “block upgrade” programs to pump up performance, at least for the most part, Ray added.\n“We don’t do block upgrades, unless it is incredibly significant,” he said. “We do increments and updates. And those … don’t take big depo mod lines, you can do it right there on the flight line; you can do it right there at the airplane.”\nRay explained that because of this new way of working, the program not only move fast but keep stability in the requirements even while making improvements. “We can keep requirements stable — and the two big challenges to any acquisition system are stable requirements and stable funding,” he said.\nThe Air Force has asked for $2.87 billion\nin its fiscal 2022 budget request\nfor the B-21, an increase of only $30 million over last year’s appropriation. While the program is deeply shrouded in secrecy, the service has said it expects the first model should fly some time in 2022, and a second is currently being built at the Northrop facility in Palmdale, Calif.\nARRW Optimism\nRay was optimistic about progress with the ARRW, despite what he called “a few small challenges.”\nARRW, a joint Air Force and DARPA project being developed by Lockheed Martin, is a boost-glide vehicle that uses rocket propulsion to bring a glide vehicle up to speeds greater than Mach 5. The ARRW’s booster rocket failed its first flight test on April 5,\nthe service announced April 6,\nwith the booster simply failing to launch from the B-52 H Stratofortress. It was the eighth test for the ARRW.\n“I think we’re gonna do fine with it here next month,” Ray said regarding the ARRW. “Talking to (Brig.) Gen. Collins (program executive officer at the service’s armament directorate), you know, they’re being smart about this,” he said. “We’ll get there. This is not a problem that’s beyond us; it’s just a matter of time.”\nThe Air Force has requested $161 million in procurement funds to buy 12 ARRWs. The service also budgeted another $238 million in research and development funds for the program. The budget documents explain that the 2022 R&D effort is “near completion” and that those funds will be used to “complete manufacture and flight test of ARRW all-up round test vehicles; transition program to early operational capability.”\nRay said he didn’t have the details at his fingertips about whether all 12 ARRWs actually bought would be used for only for flight testing, or whether some would be kept for operational use.\nRay is a big booster for hypersonic missiles, touting the role of the Air Force in long-range strike — and\nstrongly pushing back on the Army’s hypersonic missile plans\nthat he quite obviously sees as an encroachment on Air Force turf.\nAs well as supporting ARRW, Ray was an early advocate for equipping the bomber fleet with the super-secret\nHypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM).\nHACM will use an air-breathing scramjet engine rather than a boost-glide vehicle. Since it would be much smaller than ARRW, HACM could be fitted not just to big bombers but to Air Force fighters as well.\nHACM is a “new start” for 2022, according to the Air Force budget justification documents. The service has slated slightly more than $200 million in research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) money for the effort.\n“The HACM project integrates Air Force and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) enabled system technologies into a prototype that will demonstrate the viability of a multi-mission weapon concept to be fielded as a long range prompt strike capability. HACM will design, develop, manufacture, and test, a number of prototype vehicles to inform decisions concerning future HACM acquisition and production,” the budget documents say.\nPlanned project activities during 2022 will include: “Contract Award, Digital System Modeling, Weapons Open System Architecture (WOSA) Evaluation, begin Operational Flight Program (OFP) Development, begin building aircraft integration assets, conduct Wind Tunnel Testing.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-92717\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/B-21-in-Ellsworth-AFB-hangar-1024x512.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/B-21-in-Ellsworth-AFB-hangar-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/B-21-in-Ellsworth-AFB-hangar-300x150.jpg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/B-21-in-Ellsworth-AFB-hangar-768x384.jpg 768w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/B-21-in-Ellsworth-AFB-hangar-210x105.jpg 210w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/B-21-in-Ellsworth-AFB-hangar.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"/>WASHINGTON: The novel requirements and acquisition processes being used to develop the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/b-21-raider/\">B-21 bomber</a> will slash the time it will take to get the Raider to initial operating capability (IOC), Air Force Global Strike Commander <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/gen-timothy-ray/\">Gen.

{"title": "Space Force Digital Vision Focuses On Speedy Decisions", "publish_time": "2021-05-06 15:23:03", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) is creating a new virtual testing environment to apply\ndigital engineering\ntechniques to space acquisition — the first step in implementing the Space Force’s just-released Vision for a Digital Service.\nSMC, which is transitioning to the new\nSpace Systems Command\n, “is responsible for establishing the initial digital engineering ecosystem that we will use for our pathfinder programs,”\nMaj. Gen. Kim Crider,\nSpace Force chief technology innovation officer, told reporters this morning. “We’re going to stand up an initial capability this year.\n“So just to be clear, this is a basically putting in place the infrastructure and integrating the digital engineering tools — the modeling tools and the data — to support the digital engineering process,” she explained. This includes the use of\ndigital twins\n— computer-generated 3D models that allow engineers to experiment and test weapon systems virtually.\nIn fact, she noted, that cloud-based testing environment can already host unclassified work by Space Force personnel and industry contractors; it will be expanded to allow classified work in “late summer, early fall.”\nAnd beginning this year, she elaborated, “three pathfinder programs in our SATCOM portfolio will use the environment to collaborate with industry partners, exchange digital twins, and conduct program reviews all in a digital format.”\nThe three programs are all related to the\nlong-running SMC efforts to build future jam-resistant SATCOM capabilities\n— bundled under the Protected Anti-Jam Satellite Communications (PATS) family of systems — first as a complement (and back-up) to, and later as replacements for the\nAdvanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite network.\nThey are:\nProtected Satellite Communications (PTS), a tactical alternative to AEHF;\nEvolved Strategic SATCOM (ESS), a future highly-protected milsatcom system; and,\nProtected Tactical Enterprise Service (PTES), a ground system to improve cybersecurity for the Wideband Global Satcom, or WGS, satellites.\nGen. Jay Raymond, Space Force chief, stressed that the new digital vision applies not just to service acquisition, but to everything the newest military service does with a bottom-line goal of speeding decision-making.\n“We’ve spent the last year building a large capability development process, and it begins with force design, moves to requirements, then moves to acquisition. And then, testing. And so this digital thread is going to be important to that entire lifecycle or that entire ecosystem.”\nFor example, Crider said that building a “digital headquarters” is the “second line of effort” in implementing the new vision. “These are efforts to enable incentivize data driven analytics to enhance smart decision making; automation to eliminate process delays; and collaboration tools to increase shared awareness and focus the right actions on the right problems at the right level.”\nIn addition, she said, Space Force is partnering with the\nJoint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC)\n“to apply artificial intelligence/machine learning to provide commanders with key operations intelligence information on critical, high-interest objects in seconds … accelerating our ability to detect ID and track threats.”\nRaymond stressed that he sees space domain awareness as the area “most ripe for immediate wins” in implementing the new digital vision.\nThe\n“U.S. Space Force Vision for a Digital Service”\ntouches on everything from building a modern IT infrastructure to developing new decision-making tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) to building the “technical prowess” of the work force to partnering with innovative companies.\nThe document is a follow-on from Raymond’s\nChief of Space Operations Planning Guidance\n, and his “born digital” mantra for Space Force. The CSO Planning Guidance lists “Create a Digital Service to Accelerate Innovation” as one of Raymond’s five top priorities.

Gen. Kim Crider,</a> Space Force chief technology innovation officer, told reporters this morning. “We’re going to stand up an initial capability this year.</p>\n<p>“So just to be clear, this is a basically putting in place the infrastructure and integrating the digital engineering tools — the modeling tools and the data — to support the digital engineering process,” she explained. This includes the use of <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/digital-twins/\">digital twins</a> — computer-generated 3D models that allow engineers to experiment and test weapon systems virtually.</p>\n<p>In fact, she noted, that cloud-based testing environment can already host unclassified work by Space Force personnel and industry contractors; it will be expanded to allow classified work in “late summer, early fall.”</p>\n<p>And beginning this year, she elaborated, “three pathfinder programs in our SATCOM portfolio will use the environment to collaborate with industry partners, exchange digital twins, and conduct program reviews all in a digital format.”</p>\n<p>The three programs are all related to the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/02/space-force-wants-5b-for-anti-jam-satcoms/\">long-running SMC efforts to build future jam-resistant SATCOM capabilities </a>— bundled under the Protected Anti-Jam Satellite Communications (PATS) family of systems — first as a complement (and back-up) to, and later as replacements for the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/advanced-extremely-high-frequency-aehf-satellites/\">Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite network.</a> They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protected Satellite Communications (PTS), a tactical alternative to AEHF;</li>\n<li>Evolved Strategic SATCOM (ESS), a future highly-protected milsatcom system; and,</li>\n<li>Protected Tactical Enterprise Service (PTES), a ground system to improve cybersecurity for the Wideband Global Satcom, or WGS, satellites.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gen. Jay Raymond, Space Force chief, stressed that the new digital vision applies not just to service acquisition, but to everything the newest military service does with a bottom-line goal of speeding decision-making.</p>\n<p>“We’ve spent the last year building a large capability development process, and it begins with force design, moves to requirements, then moves to acquisition. And then, testing. And so this digital thread is going to be important to that entire lifecycle or that entire ecosystem.”</p>\n<p>For example, Crider said that building a “digital headquarters” is the “second line of effort” in implementing the new vision. “These are efforts to enable incentivize data driven analytics to enhance smart decision making; automation to eliminate process delays; and collaboration tools to increase shared awareness and focus the right actions on the right problems at the right level.”</p>\n<p>In addition, she said, Space Force is partnering with the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/joint-artificial-intelligence-center/\">Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC)</a> “to apply artificial intelligence/machine learning to provide commanders with key operations intelligence information on critical, high-interest objects in seconds … accelerating our ability to detect ID and track threats.”</p>\n<p>Raymond stressed that he sees space domain awareness as the area “most ripe for immediate wins” in implementing the new digital vision.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.spaceforce.mil/News/Article/2597623/space-force-unveils-its-vision-for-a-digital-service/\">“U.S. Space Force Vision for a Digital Service”</a> touches on everything from building a modern IT infrastructure to developing new decision-making tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) to building the “technical prowess” of the work force to partnering with innovative companies.</p>\n<p>The document is a follow-on from Raymond’s <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2020/Nov/09/2002531998/-1/-1/0/CSO%20PLANNING%20GUIDANCE.PDF\">Chief of Space Operations Planning Guidance</a>, and his “born digital” mantra for Space Force. The CSO Planning Guidance lists “Create a Digital Service to Accelerate Innovation” as one of Raymond’s five top priorities.

The bill now goes to the House. President Biden has said he supports the bill.\nSen. Ben Sasse introduced the amendment to increase DARPA’s annual budget by $3.5 billion, which will bring the total authorized funding to $7 billion over the next five years, according to a spokesperson in the senator’s office.\n“I’m glad we won big victories by doubling DARPA’s budget and developing new sanction authorities to go after China for stealing American intellectual property,” Sasse said in a statement provided to\nBreaking Defense\n. “As a China hawk and a fiscal hawk, I would have liked for this bill to take a more focused and aggressive approach to the China threat – but this is a strong start.

Some of these chips will have defense use cases. The funding comes as the world faces a shortage of chips, which experts say will likely last through 2022 and quite possibly into 2023. As <em>BD</em> readers <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/06/dod-seeks-2-3b-to-bolster-chip-making/\">know</a>, the proposed <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/defense-budget-2022/\">2022 defense budget</a> called the US chip supply chain “fragile and threatened.”</p>\n<p>The bill includes $1.5 billion for 5G research and development.</p>\n<p>In addition to funding US initiatives, the bill includes a slew of measures enabling the US to sanction Beijing over everything from cyberattacks and intellectual property theft to human rights violations.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, China is drafting legislation to make countries choose who to side with on sanctions — the US and European Union or China. <em>The Global Times</em>, an English language nationalist mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party, reported that the draft legislation gives China the ability to sanction any country who cooperates with US/EU sanctions against China.</p>\n<p>The law, <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202106/1225618.shtml\">according to</a> the Chinese publication, “will deter foreign governments, notably the US and the EU, from resorting to long-arm jurisdiction ...If Chinese entities are hit with unjustified sanctions, the proposed law is supposed to crystallize actionable countermeasures against the foreign governments and institutions... expecting the legal effort to make up for losses that Chinese entities would suffer.”</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["5G", "5G networks", "advanced communications", "advanced manufacturing", "AI", "Congress", "darpa", "emerging technology", "endless frontier act", "quantum computing", "research and development", "Sen.

{"title": "‘The Future Is About Information Dominance:’ Gen. Nakasone", "publish_time": "2021-06-29 22:06:43", "author": ["Brad D. Williams"], "content": "WASHINGTON:\nFuture competition and conflict will hinge on “information dominance” — a mission that will play out largely in cyberspace but that cannot be separated from conventional military operations, CYBERCOM chief Gen. Paul Nakasone said today.\n“The future is about information — information dominance,” Nakasone said during the U.S Naval Institute and Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association annual\nWEST Conference\n. For context, Nakasone made the comment about the future after reflecting on key moments in the decade-long existence of CYBERCOM, an organization he has been involved with since the beginning and took leadership of in 2018. Nakasone also leads the NSA and the Central Security Service.\n“Too often we think of cyberspace as distinct from the physical fight. That’s not always the case,” Nakasone said, adding that the virtual and the physical are increasingly intertwined. In this way, he said, “events in the virtual battlefield inform and reflect the physical battlefield.”\nThe theme of “information dominance” seems to reflect broader views about the changing global competitive environment. The US military, more broadly, is modernizing even as it repositions from a two-decade focus on thwarting terrorism to “competing” against “near-peers” China and Russia. Significant aspects of this so-called “near-peer competition” are already playing out in cyberspace.\nChina has also stressed its\ngoal to control the information environment\n.\nAs\nBreaking D\nreaders know, a\nrecent International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) study\nfound the US stands alone as the only tier-one global cyber power. China, the study found, is poised to challenge the US’s current “clear superiority” in cyberspace within the next decade.\n“Information dominance” also seems, in part perhaps, related to what Army Maj. Gen. Peter Gallagher, who heads the Army’s network modernization for Futures Command,\nhas called\nthe concept of “\ndecision dominance\n.” Gallagher’s comments reflect the goal of\nJoint All Domain Command and Control\n, or JADC2, characterized as a meta-networking strategy for coordinating military operations across land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. Timely information for decision-makers and control of the information environment are viewed as integral to the success of JADC2.\nIn discussing the “threat picture,” Nakasone detailed three familiar themes from recent speeches and congressional testimony. The first is the growing scope of what the US must defend and protect in cyberspace, owing to a “much broader” attack surface, to include weapons systems and an exponentially expanding trove of military data. As\nBreaking D\nreaders know, data will be a key enabler of JADC2.\nThe second theme is the scale of cyberattacks, evidenced recently by high-profile cyber campaigns such as\nSolarWinds\n,\nMicrosoft Exchange server hacks\n, and\nColonial Pipeline\n. Nakasone observed that near-peer competitors China and Russia have executed “persistent, malicious campaigns” that shouldn’t be thought of as “episodic.”\n“We’re not in Kansas anymore,” Nakasone said, noting US adversaries have invested in and operationalized cyber.\nHis third theme is\nhow sophisticated the US’s cyber adversaries\nsometimes prove to be. However, he also noted, sometimes they’ve found success with simpler techniques. The key is to recognize how adversaries are adapting and to engage accordingly.\nNakasone pointed to three tasks he views as important going forward. First is the hard work of integrating cyber across the military, government, allies, and partners. The second is strengthening cyber defenses. The third is continued development of a pool of domestic cyber talent by finding ways to attract, train, and retain a generation of elite cyber warriors.\n“It’s not all about the money, trust me,” Nakasone said, referring to the temptation of higher-paying jobs in the private sector. “But it’s also not all about the mission either. We need to be open to new ideas about career development.”\nTo this last point, Nakasone challenged the audience to “think differently.”\n“We have incredible technology, incredible tradecraft, but the most important thing we have is talent,” Nakasone said. He noted the importance of\nmilitary reserves and the National Guard,\nwhich he referred to collectively as “our strategic depth,” as well as the importance of the civilian workforce, which he said currently constitutes about 60 percent of CYBERCOM headquarters staff and which provides “continuity, experience, and mentoring.”\nBut it’s not just CYBERCOM that will play a role in America’s cyber future. Nakasone touted NSA’s role, with its dual missions of signals intelligence and cybersecurity. Nakasone pointed to the importance of cryptology, an NSA specialty, in cyber defenses. “The true backstop is encryption,” he said, “to protect weapons systems and data.” The stronger the US’s crypto capabilities, “the better off we’ll be.”\n“I close with optimism,” Nakasone said, “balanced with the realization we have work to do.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-40257\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Cyber.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"890\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Cyber.jpg 890w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Cyber-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Cyber-768x431.jpg 768w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Cyber-230x130.jpg 230w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Cyber-210x118.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px\"/> WASHINGTON: Future competition and conflict will hinge on “information dominance” — a mission that will play out largely in cyberspace but that cannot be separated from conventional military operations, CYBERCOM chief Gen.

The lawmakers trimmed a mere $25 million from the overall procurement request of $2.77 billion, while cutting $492 million from the research, development, test and evaluation (RTD&E) request of $11.26 billion. (Intriguingly, one of the biggest individual line-item cuts in RTD&E was to “classified programs” — with HAC chopping $410.5 million from Space Force’s request of $4.475 billion.)\nThat said, the HAC is clearly unhappy with space acquisition management and lawmakers are largely unconvinced that proposed changes in the Space Force’s organizational structure will resolve long-standing problems.\nThe HAC report notes that the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) has concluded that the planned launch in 2025 of the first\nNext Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR)\nmissile warning program satellite, being built by Lockheed Martin, is “unrealistic” and that the program’s overall cost estimate is “overly optimistic.”\n“The Committee cautions the Space Force that providing unrealistic cost and schedule estimates undermines the credibility of the Space Force’s management of this and other programs,” the report warned.\nWhile the HAC fully funded the $2.54 billion request for Next-Gen OPIR, the lawmakers demanded a thorough program scrub and required Space Force to report back in 180 days after the defense appropriations bill is passed.\nThe report dedicates an entire page to detailing the committee’s dissatisfaction with what it sees as foot-dragging on space acquisition reform — which was one of the\nprimary congressional rationales for the creation\nof the new space service in the first place. Indeed, the HAC reiterates: “The Committee believes the Space Force was established to bring greater attention and focus to fixing its acquisition issues because previous attempts to do so did not produce lasting results.”\nThe HAC’s concerns include that that Department of the Air Force — which oversees the Space Force much as the Navy oversees the Marine Corps — still has no clear plan for creating a separate management chain for space acquisition. Similar concerns were\nvoiced at a May hearing by both the chair and ranking members of the HAC defense subcommittee,\nRep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., and Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., respectively.\nThe 2020 NDAA required that the Air Force appoint a Senate-confirmed assistant secretary for space acquisition and integration.

{"title": "Manufacturing Tactical Vehicles On A World-Class Level", "publish_time": "2021-06-07 12:51:40", "author": ["Barry Rosenberg"], "content": "GM Defense is currently building the Infantry Squad Vehicle for the U.S. Army and has its sights on winning more pursuits.\nWhen the Army awarded the Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV) program to General Motors Defense (GM Defense) in mid-2020, it heralded the reincarnation of a new company built to take advantage of technical and manufacturing advancements from GM’s commercial automotive side and re-imagine them for application across tactical ground vehicles for the U.S. Army and others.\nWith its recently-opened production facility in Concord, North Carolina, GM Defense has its sights on future tactical-vehicle needs for the Army and other customers. From start of construction to vehicle production, the company stood up a state-of-the-art tactical wheeled vehicle manufacturing center in just over 90 days, demonstrating its fast-to-field capabilities and manufacturing prowess. Incorporating some of the latest manufacturing tools into the facility, GM Defense can help ensure the highest level of quality while driving greater efficiencies to support Infantry Squad Vehicle production.\nGM is investing more than $27 billion between now and the end of 2025 in a seismic shift toward alternate/electric propulsion in addition to manufacturing. GM Defense plans to leverage those investments to improve the design, manufacture and sustainment of tactical ground vehicles.\nThe timing of GM’s new investments in manufacturing infrastructure for the commercial market will help GM Defense meet strong expectations for growth in the global, armored vehicle market. According to Fortune Business Insights, this market is expected to grow from about $17.2 billion in 2018 to about $26.1 billion in 2026. The U.S. market is the largest in the world at $6.6 billion, according to the report, Armored Vehicle Market 2019-2026.\n“The demand for armored vehicles is increasing due to the frequent occurrence of cross-border conflicts and asymmetric warfare across the globe,” the report states. “The development of military armored vehicle technologies combines innovations from areas such as electronics, weaponry, automotive, and material science…to create products and services that adopt technologies such as lightweight materials for vehicle body/structure, (and) use electricity to power the vehicle.”\nRising demand for light armored vehicles and armored personnel carriers are driving the growth of the combat vehicle segment of the market, according to Fortune. The ISV is a light all-terrain troop carrier for a nine-soldier infantry squad and can be designed to include armor, storage, or different seating configurations depending on customer needs and requirements. It is based on GM’s 2020 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 midsize truck architecture.\nRonda Uhl, chief manufacturing engineer at GM Defense with the Infantry Squad Vehicle.\nBringing Commercial Vehicle Quality to the Military\n“The financial investment in quality and manufacturing that GM is now putting in place across GM Defense and elsewhere is at a level I’ve not seen at other defense companies,” said Ronda Uhl, chief manufacturing engineer at GM Defense. “I think that’s really important. Something else that I think is incredibly important is our ability to put into place very disciplined actions and processes for quality.”\nThat’s not just a GM executive entering her third decade in manufacturing with the company saying that. It is bona fides earned and acknowledged by independent market-research firms.\n“GM Defense and the entire company use our best, competitive processes from all of our manufacturing sites around the world to build high-quality, highly integrated products,” said Uhl. “Our approach is based on decades of proven production and quality processes that enable us to rapidly scale up or scale down depending on the customer needs. These processes also continuously drive us to find new ways to increase efficiencies and eliminate waste, which can result in cost savings.”\nFrom start of construction to vehicle production, GM Defense stood up its new Concord, N.C. production facility in just over 90 days.\nWhile the ISV is currently in low-volume production, GM Defense can leverage GM’s ability to flex in order to support much higher production rates, while also incorporating our latest manufacturing tools to ensure high levels of quality and efficiency for existing and future customers.\nIncorporating the Military Voice\nFor GM Defense, manufacturing and quality go hand in hand. Through GM’s vast experience in vehicle manufacturing, the company has developed repeatable processes for the build of vehicles for the commercial market. GM Defense has adapted these processes for military vehicles. Regardless of the job—from propulsion component construction to final vehicle assembly—GM Defense employs the same standardized quality processes and systems developed commercially throughout its worldwide manufacturing operations.\n“It drives disciplined action, and I think that gets into what sets us apart,” said Uhl. “The other companies building military vehicles have their own quality processes, but none can say that they’ve honed their defense-production processes with world-class efficiencies that flow from GM’s commercial operations. In addition, the more we build in high levels of quality on the front end of the build, the more potential savings we can help customers realize during vehicle sustainment.”\nQuality at GM Defense also derives from hearing and internalizing the Army/military voice about what the drivers, crew, and maintainers want in a 21st century tactical vehicle. That’s especially important in this time where U.S. military forces must sustain operations against increasingly complex threats from around the world.\n“Listening to the customer is not a cliché; it’s of enormous importance because the military and government services, for that matter, want to know that you understand their needs,” said Uhl. “It’s not just that you can support their mission the best, but that you can listen to what they want in their vehicle and flex as requirements evolve. The investments in manufacturing advancements that we’ve brought to GM Defense, along with the depth of our engineering and design knowledge, allow us to do that.”\nInnovating Alternative Power\nMilitary services around the world have high expectations for future propulsion systems beyond diesel and gasoline powerplants, including all-electric solutions to hybrid-electric motors, batteries, and hydrogen fuel cells. For example, the U.S. Navy’s FFG(X) next-generation guided missile frigate will be propelled by hybrid-electric power (HEP).\nThis is the first time that the Navy is putting HEP in a combatant ship like a frigate or destroyer (though the service does use HEP to improve fuel efficiency and maintenance on auxiliary ships in the fleet). Of the four international teams that bid on FFG(X) only the winner—Wisconsin-based Fincantieri Marinette Marine (FMM), a subsidiary of Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri—proposed a hybrid-electric drive system to provide propulsion.\nWhile not as mature as Navy electrification efforts, the Army is also on a clear path to the eventual powering of ground tactical vehicles with hybrid-electric engines and alternative fuels. In Q4 2020, the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command’s Army Research Laboratory awarded the University of Wisconsin-Madison a four year, $11.5 million contract for research that’s expected to lead to new designs of multi-fuel capable hybrid-electric engines for not only future Army ground vehicles but also for aerial vehicles.\nThe goal is to answer key questions about integrating battery electric technologies into the fight and hybrid-electric engines in future Army propulsion and power-generation systems, according to Mike Kweon, program manager for the laboratory’s Versatile Tactical Power and Propulsion Essential Research Program, speaking in an Army news release.\nIn addition to propulsion, the Navy and Army are looking for batteries to provide the additional power generation necessary to support the electrical load of ships and vehicles, respectively. Electric load management will be an important consideration for both services as they’re key to deployment of directed-energy weapons that are now being developed for counter-unmanned aerial systems, for example.\nGM’s Marriage to Electric Power\nAs the Army continues to seek out expertise in electrification, it will find no better teammate for alternative drive solutions than GM, which pioneered the electric car era in 1996 with the first mass produced electric vehicle—the Chevrolet EV1. Since then, the company has pursued a strategy of applying electrification where it will make the biggest possible impact—from GM/Allison hybrid transit buses, the “Project Driveway” fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) Equinox, the Two-Mode Tahoe, and Yukon Hybrids. A few months ago, the company unveiled the GMC HUMMER EV—the world’s first all-electric super truck with robust off-road capabilities—and a few weeks ago, the GMC HUMMER EV SUV. Between the company’s most recent revolutionary EV models and the Chevy Bolt EV launched in 2017, GM has produced more than 300,000 EVs.\nToday, GM is planning to offer dozens of new EVs and the billions of dollars that it will spend on electric and electric-autonomous vehicle programs through 2025 is more than it will spend on gasoline and diesel products. GM is putting much of that investment into battery technology and by mid-decade, its next-generation Ultium batteries are projected to deliver twice the energy density at less than half the cost of today’s battery chemistry.\nUltium batteries are unique in the industry because the large-format, pouch-style cells can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside the battery pack. This allows engineers to optimize battery energy storage and layout for each vehicle design. Vehicles built on the Ultium Platform are capable of a range up to 450 miles on a single charge with a GM-estimated 0 to 60 mph acceleration in as low as 3 seconds.\nGM is investing not only in battery technology, but also in manufacturing facilities to meet commercial needs. GM Defense can leverage these capabilities to meet future military electrification powertrain requirements.\n“Enabling a commercial all-electric future also requires the development and introduction of new technologies into our manufacturing sites for components and vehicles,” said Uhl. “The $27 billion that GM has committed to manufacturing new, advanced propulsion sources will enable us to not only execute an all-electric future for the commercial automotive industry, but also to be ready to respond to defense customers and their mission needs for alternative power and propulsion systems.”\nConclusion\nFresh off its first major win in the Army’s Infantry Squad Vehicle competition, GM Defense has let it be known that it is back in the defense business and is bringing forward the commercial capabilities of General Motors to military vehicles. For the ISV and future programs such as Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), as well as the Army’s Electric Light Reconnaissance Vehicle program that is currently shaping requirements to meet soldier needs, the Army can depend on GM Defense to deliver and execute in three areas.\n* GM Defense is delivering world-class manufacturing capabilities that can scale to any volume production number—both up and down—to fulfill the customer needs.\n* GM Defense’s manufacturing processes are driven by disciplined action, execution of proven quality processes, and incorporation of the customer voice throughout vehicle development, manufacturing, and sustainment. This enables us to respond quickly to customer needs to support mission success.\n* Few companies in the world are investing as much as GM is in future mobility. The $27 billion commitment through 2025 specifically to facilitate electric and autonomous vehicle development and manufacturing, underscores the company’s commitment to meeting the needs of the marketplace—whether commercial consumers or military customers.", "content_html": "<div><div class=\"entry\">\n<div id=\"attachment_158888\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/DSC_3823-full-v1__reduced-file-size.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-158888\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-158888 size-full\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/DSC_3823-full-v1__reduced-file-size.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/DSC_3823-full-v1__reduced-file-size.jpg 1981w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/DSC_3823-full-v1__reduced-file-size-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/DSC_3823-full-v1__reduced-file-size-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/DSC_3823-full-v1__reduced-file-size-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/DSC_3823-full-v1__reduced-file-size-210x140.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1981px) 100vw, 1981px\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-158888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">GM Defense is currently building the Infantry Squad Vehicle for the U.S. Army and has its sights on winning more pursuits.</p></div>\n<p>When the Army awarded the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3fqAHFa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV)</strong></a> program to General Motors Defense (GM Defense) in mid-2020, it heralded the reincarnation of a new company built to take advantage of technical and manufacturing advancements from GM’s commercial automotive side and re-imagine them for application across tactical ground vehicles for the U.S. Army and others.</p>\n<p>With its recently-opened production facility in Concord, North Carolina, GM Defense has its sights on future tactical-vehicle needs for the Army and other customers.

{"title": "Aboard USS Ford: More Weapons, More Launches, Faster & Safer", "publish_time": "2020-11-25 15:00:42", "author": ["Robbin Laird"], "content": "SOMEWHERE OFF THE EAST COAST: When our aging C-2 Greyhound aircraft took off from\nthe USS Gerald R. Ford\nthe experience was clearly different. Propelled by the electro-magnetic system that has replaced steam catapults it was much smoother and much quicker.\nThe new launch and landing systems provide key tools for a significant reshaping of the operational tempo for the large deck carrier.\nThe new launch system allows for a wider range of aircraft to operate from the carrier; the new arresting gear system can recover them. The ability to mix and match the current air fleet and the future one is significantly enhanced with EMALS, which will allow everything from F-35s to the fleet’s future unmanned aircraft to take off and land aboard the new class of carriers.\nThe same flexibility exists in the Advanced Arresting Gear with larger current operating wind and weight envelopes and the ability to recover future aircraft designs with minimal modifications required.\nThe speed of launch and recovery was on full display during our Nov. 17 visit. Currently, the Ford has two-third of its air wings on board, with two air wings and four squadrons operating from the deck. The carrier is at sea currently working what the US Navy calls cyclic operations, where strike packages are launched in clusters and then operate in the combat space to provide for the various missions done by the Navy at sea. Normally, at this stage in the certification of a new carrier, cyclic operations would not be performed.\nThe launch and recovery systems are just one example of the changes from the Nimitz Class to the Ford class.\nA key change is with how weapons move from the lower decks of the shop to aircraft. On a Nimitz class carrier, a “weapons farm” on the ship’s flight deck is where they are staged for assembly and worked with components brought from various levels of the ship and then transported by a hydraulic system which pulls the elevator up with wires and ropes. The weapons need to be moved through one of the two mess decks before being transported on deck. And prior to loading the weapons onto the aircraft, there is the challenge of finishing the weapons preparation prior to weapons loading.\nThis process changes onboard the Ford.\nBelow the flight deck are two very large weapons assembly and loading areas, where the weapons are readied for transportation to the flight deck for loading onto aircraft. These two large areas allow the ordinance team to prepare weapons of various complexity out of the weather, which makes the process much more rapid and safer.\nIt is clear the new carrier will be able to support multi-mission operations. There is enhanced capability for the crew to build weapons packages below deck and transport them rapidly to the flight deck. This will give the ship the ability to mix and match flight strike packages or ISR packages much more rapidly.\n“We can move more weapons in a safer way, a faster way to a flight deck that is larger and more flexible. And that all contributes to the kind of agility, lethality, and flexibility the Ford brings to the fight,” Rear Adm. Clapperton, Commander Strike Group 12, told us.\nThe Ford’s flight deck differs substantially from those of the Nimitz class. The island has been moved 140 feet aft and is 30% smaller. This allows significant additional space for aircraft refueling and weapons loading operations, with the area forward of the island able to accommodate more combat aircraft. During flight operations, Ford’s design increases the amount of usable space forward of the island and reduces the amount unusable space aft.\nAnother example is the refueling system, designed to keep a clear path to the catapult by reducing flight deck obstructions caused by refueling hoses, weapons skids and weapons elevator access points. This allows the Ford to sustain higher launch and recovery rates. The in-deck refueling stations keep the Ford’s refueling hoses out of the taxi paths to the catapult.\nThis has a major impact because, on the Nimitz, the refueling crew has to carry several, heavy and long fuel hoses from the starboard side of the Nimitz class to do mid-deck refueling. On the Ford, the hoses are right beside the in-deck refueling stations and rather than having to have a crew of 5 people to bring the hoses 150 feet to mid-deck and do refueling, you only need two crew to man the in-deck refueling stations.\nLast month, I spent two days with the senior leadership of the Ford and talked with many members of the crew. What I had a chance to see and discuss during that visit was the new combat architecture built into the ship which allows for a very different workflow than a Nimitz class carrier, which allows for significant advances in sortie generation rates, as well as new ways to manage the deck space in empowering air operations from the very formidable warship.\nA crucial aspect of the Ford are the C2 capabilities and roles of the carrier, which I\nobserved in October\nbut not on this visit. The mission operations areas are much larger than on the Nimitiz and are being configured for the kinds of information warfare as well maritime distributed operations which the new carrier will execute at greater distance in blue water maneuver warfare operations.\nBut what was on the ship at sea, and not visible during the October visit, were the full complement of warfare officers, bringing the various warfare competencies to the command deck. One notable member was the commander of an Aegis destroyer, as Aegis will have a combat officer onboard the Ford working the various ways Aegis and the carrier will work together in the blue water maneuver space.\nThis is not simply a new carrier; this is a whole re-imaging of the large deck carrier being introduced into the new strategic situation and shaping new combat capabilities with the fleet, the joint services, notably the USAF and with coalition partners.

Like GDIT, Microsoft then suffered through a long delay after\na losing bidder, Amazon, sought to overturn the award\n. Like GDIT, Microsoft was re-awarded the contract by the Pentagon\nthis fall\n.

To be specific, the expert added, the issue is\nbig\ncloud contracts. The Defense Department says its various services and subcomponents have more than 500 clouds. But the Pentagon’s attempts to consolidate cloud computing keep running aground.\n“It seems to me as long as you keep the scope narrow and the customer focused, they’ve got plenty of them out there,” the source said. “The challenge seems to be getting something DoD-wide.”\nIn the DEOS case specifically, the government accidentally\nleaked confidential pricing information\nfrom Perspecta’s bid to GDIT.

Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: The Army has cancelled a\nNational Guard\nbrigade’s planned deployment to\nCombat Training Center\nwargames next year, but the other 19 brigade rotations to Fort Irwin and Fort Polk will proceed as planned.\nWe don’t have data for the third CTC, the\nJoint Multinational Readiness Center\nin Germany, because it falls under a different command.\nThe intense exercises at the CTCs are the\ngold standard\nfor Army training,\nas Gen. James McConville\n, the chief of staff, said earlier this week at the\nannual AUSA conference\n. How many units get to go to CTC is not only significant in itself. It’s often seen as a proxy for Army readiness writ large. But the wargames and the work-up beforehand are grueling, and Army leaders are looking to\nstreamline training to reduce stress\non their heavily burdened soldiers.\nSo how do next year’s number hold up to history? The 19 rotations remaining for 2021 is above the 18 that were planned for 2020, and five of those had to be\ncancelled due to COVID\n, Army staffers told me. In fact, 19 is slightly above the average for the five-year period pre-COVID, 2015-2019. But 19 is slightly below the pre-COVID\npeak\n, the 21 rotations in 2019.\nNot all rotations are created equal, however. Just because a brigade is going to “the box” – the designated territory where simulated battles are held – that doesn’t mean the\nentire\nbrigade is going. Army\nForces Command\n, which oversees stateside training, always has the option to deploy only part of a brigade, instead of the entire unit, if it’s deemed necessary to reduce stress on the troops.\nThat’s an option which Army leaders recently said\nshould\nbe taken for at least some units. “To further reduce the demands of training for and supporting CTC rotations, not all Brigade Combat Teams will deploy all of their battalions into ‘the box,’” wrote\nArmy Secretary Ryan McCarthy\n, Gen. McConville, and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Grinston in\nan Oct. 13 post\non Army.mil.\nAny such decision, however, will be made on a case-by-case basis by the commanders involved, a Forces Command spokesman told me. “The structure of the remaining units participating in the FY 2021 CTC rotations have not changed,” Col. James Rawlinson wrote in an email. “These rotations are shaped during dialogues between the senior unit commanders at Corps and Divisions, the respective CTC Commander, and the FORSCOM CG... the respective CTC would tailor the rotation based on the guidance the FORSCOM CG provides.”\nMcCarthy, McConville, and Grinston also said they would cancel some of the intense workups that brigades were historically required to do at home base before they were considered ready for the CTCs. “To reduce OPTEMPO [operational tempo],” they wrote, “we will minimize gated training requirements and eliminate the requirement to conduct brigade and battalion Live Fire Exercises and Field Training Exercises prior to a CTC rotation.”\nWhy do units prepare so intensively for their CTC tours? For most soldiers, Combat Training Center exercises are the greatest test they’ll face short of battle. A “rotation” to the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin – for armor – or the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk – for infantry – is traditionally the peak of a brigade’s training cycle, a kind of graduation exercise before the unit is certified as ready to deploy to war. During the decades of counterinsurgency in Afghanistan and Iraq, the CTCs were set up with mock villages, inhabited by contracted roleplayers acting as civilians and guerillas, but lately they’ve refocused on\nsimulating a high-tech threat like that of Russia\n.\nArmy leaders sent seemingly conflicting signals on CTCs this week during the annual AUSA conference, and I’ve spent the last few days working with Army staff to get the story straight.\nWhile the Army is seeking to reduce the stress on its soldiers, Gen. McConville said at AUSA on Tuesday, “there’s no intent to reduce Combat Training Center rotations for units.”\nBut later that same day, the FORSCOM commander, Gen. Michael Garrett, said the pace of CTC rotations in the last few years before COVID was “\ncertainly not sustainable\n” and would come down.\nSo which is it? Well, if you look at the data the Army provided me, you can find support for either statement, depending on how narrowly or broadly you make your comparison.\nCTC rotations had been trending upward before COVID, peaking at 21 last year: Presumably it’s this increasing pace that Garrett considers “not sustainable.” The data also show that post-COVID rotations will not return to that pre-COVID peak, as Garrett said, at least not in 2021.\nWhat about McConville’s statement, that there’s “no intent” to reduce rotations? Well, the number of rotations in 2021\nis\nbeing reduced, by one, compared to the previous plan. But if you look at the wider context of 2015-2020, not just one year, then the 19 rotations remaining in ’21 is above average – in fact, it’s tied for second highest. In that bigger picture, CTC rotations are\nnot\nbeing reduced, as the Chief of Staff said.\nWhat happens after 2021? Nobody knows. With trillions spent on COVID, the entire federal government faces\na probable budget crunch\n, and\nnext month’s elections\ncould put Democrats – traditionally quicker to cut defense spending than Republicans – in control of the White House and Congress. Even if the budget were to stay flat, the need to balance readiness and modernization still has the Army working on at a wholesale overhaul of how it trains, equips, and deploys its units, what it calls the\nRegionally Aligned Readiness & Modernization Model\n(REARRM).

{"title": "Project Avenger: VR, Big Data Sharpen Navy Pilot Training", "publish_time": "2020-12-03 23:27:21", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: A new flight\ntraining\nprogram that relies heavily on\nVR simulations and detailed data\nis getting\nNavy\ntrainees better prepared for real cockpits, with some students qualifying for their first solo flight in less than half the time the traditional curriculum requires.\nSimulations don’t just give trainees plenty of digital dress rehearsals before they\nclimb into a physical aircraft\n, Navy officials told the\nvIITSEC simulation & training conference\nWednesday. Already,\nbig-data analytics\nare helping instructors and training-unit commanders better understand their students’ progress. As the technology improves in the near future,\nartificially intelligent algorithms\ncould track every aspect of a trainee’s performance in simulation, then provide detailed feedback on what to fix.\n“Project Avenger is our first experimental proof-of-concept class,” said\nRear Adm. Robert Westendorff\n. (The project name is a homage to a\nWorld War II torpedo bomber\n). “[They’re] three months along now, and we’re seeing some incredibly promising results.”\nWestendorff is the one-star\nChief of Naval Air Training\n(CNATRA, pronounced “Sinatra”). In the traditional program, he explained, each student flies with an instructor for the first dozen flights until they’re graded as “safe for solo” and allowed to fly on their own, starting around flight 13. But in Project Avenger’s more flexible curriculum, he told the conference, “our top performers were deemed safe for solo on flight five, and they flew their solo on flight six.”\nThat first Avenger class will wrap up early next year, the admiral said – at which point they’ll graduate into more advanced training classes that are still using a traditional curriculum. It’ll take three years to reform every stage of the training pipeline.\nWhat’s so different about Project Avenger’s approach? The most obvious aspect is the technology – but its real power is how that technology lets humans try new ways of teaching and learning.\nFor decades, Westendorff said, the model had been the same: “The students show up. I plop a stack of books on the desk for them. They study these books. I provide them some computer-based training, I provide them some lectures, I provide them some simulators, and then we start ... a very linear process of flight training: complete this task, okay, now move on to the next task.”\n“We’ve really upended that that entire thought process,” he said. “In Project Avenger, the students showed up and I handed them a personal learning device”: This contains not only all the usual class materials in digital form, but also allows “24-7” access to 3D videos that students can immerse themselves in using VR goggles. Students also get extensive access to low-cost, video-game-style simulations – they have a physical stick and throttle, but everything else is virtual – that they can use at will, instead of having to wait for precious time on traditional simulators that replicate the entire cockpit. (Those high-end simulators are still part of the program, but now the cheap sims let trainees rehearse more often). And all this is done in smaller classes, with instructors who have more time to get to know each student and more flexibility to tailor their instruction to individual strengths and weaknesses.\nIn the future, added\nRear Adm. Greg Harris\n, big-data analytics and artificial intelligence will provide instructors a much more precise picture of each student’s performance. They might measure a trainee’s maneuvers down to the degree and compare them to how an experienced pilot will fly, for instance.\n“There’s a real opportunity to look at data that we can pull from the background of some of these models and simulations ... and say ‘okay, Pilot A, you need to work on this skill set,’” said Harris. (He was Westendorff’s predecessor at CNATRA before being promoted to two stars and joining the Chief of Naval Operations staff in the Pentagon). Then you could give each pilot plenty of practice in relatively cheap simulators before you give them expensive flight hours in an actual aircraft. You still have to fly for real and expend expensive fossil fuels doing it, Harris said, but having more hours in simulation beforehand will “make all of the time that I spend burning dinosaurs that much more effective.”\nWestendorff is already making more use of data analytics. “When I came to CNATRA this summer,” he told the conference, “I quickly realized that we were somewhat like Major League Baseball: We had statistics and we tracked absolutely everything.... [but] we didn’t have a process, a modern process, to really analyze that data and really understand what the important statistics were.” He would sit down for monthly meetings on students’ progress, only to be briefed with data that was six weeks old. Now, he said, the command is testing a new data “dashboard” that he can log into, any time, for the latest updates.\nIt’ll take this more sophisticated approach to training to prepare pilots for\na more complicated era of war\n.\n“[Given] the complexity of our weapon systems, it’s just not enough to be a great stick and rudder pilot anymore,” Westendorff said. “You have to interpret information, and you really manage a system, or a system of systems.”\n“The end result of this is to produce [a] more capable aviator that we send off to the fleet to fight this\nhigh-end fight\n” against\ngreat-power adversaries\n, the admiral emphasized. “Now, there are some other benefits that we think we can realize here: I think I can put students through [training] in a shorter time ...and we might even be able to do it at a lower cost which is obviously a good thing, but...the ultimate goal is that more lethal warfighter that we’re sending out to\nthe fleet\n.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: A new flight <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/training-series-2020/\">training</a> program that relies heavily on <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/12/dod-official-warns-china-pulling-ahead-in-data-simulation-efforts/\">VR simulations and detailed data</a> is getting <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/12/cjcs-milley-predicts-dod-bloodletting-to-fund-navy-priorities/\">Navy</a> trainees better prepared for real cockpits, with some students qualifying for their first solo flight in less than half the time the traditional curriculum requires.</p>\n<p>Simulations don’t just give trainees plenty of digital dress rehearsals before they <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/12/t-7a-red-hawk-simulator-production-starts/\">climb into a physical aircraft</a>, Navy officials told the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/viitsec-2020/\">vIITSEC simulation & training conference</a> Wednesday.

Charles Richard told me this evening.\nThe\n2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which President Trump unsuccessfully tried to veto, raised the alarm about the cyber resiliency of the complex NC3\nnetwork of radios, satellites, computers and terminals that link the president and national leaders to the nuclear forces. It called for a sweeping report that includes a schedule, resourcing plan, and a concept of operations for improving cybersecurity — as well as a roles and missions review of who should be doing what with regard to protections.\n“I welcome that language inside the NDAA,” Richard said during a Defense Writers Group event this evening, noting that Congress is particularly focused on how the NC3 network operates and is defended. “There is a very visible endorsement of the importance of NC3 and the steps that we have to go do. I look forward to providing that report to Congress, because we’re already doing all of that: we already have that concept; we already have those responsibilities defined. And so it’s simply a matter of writing it all down and reporting it to Congress.”\nAsked whether the\nrecent SolarWinds hack by Russia that has compromised numerous federal computer networks affected NC3,\nRichard said he hasn’t seen any malware or compromised operations: “My NC3 systems are fully mission capable.”\nHe explained that the computer systems behind the NC3 network simply work differently than most other US government systems.\n“The bottom line is, NC3 is different. And it operates in relative isolation — we operate the systems differently,” Richard said. “So, no, I don’t have the same threat vectors that the larger federal government does when it comes to this particular threat.”\nFurther, STRATCOM’s program to upgrade the NC3 network, called NC3 Next, “will provide new and additional capabilities related to cyber defense,” he added.\nThat said, Richard explained that NC3 Next “is not a thing,” but a rolling initiative over time of improvements to all aspects of the complex network. NC3-related radios and terminals are\nembedded in some 62 different systems and platforms\n— from satellites such as the\nAdvanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF)\nfor hardened and encrypted strategic communications to nuclear submarines to the\nE-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) aircraft\nknown as the “Doomsday” planes. Most of those systems are\nancient\nin information technology years, with many dating back to the 1980s pre-Internet era.\nWhile he was unable to provide many details due to its classified nature, Richard said the current program of record funded in DoD’s five-year budget plan covers what is called “NC3 Increment One” in the evolutionary cycle. That first set of improvements “improves our posture in space and improves hardness to emerging cyber and cryptographic threats.” It also moves STRATCOM away from dependency on incompatible legacy systems “which in effect also improves this capability.” Finally, the Increment One also “starts to give me the ability to dynamically reconfigure” software — including cybersecurity software — to provide more resiliency, he said.\nThe next iteration, NC3 Increment 2, will involve improvements based on STRATCOM experiments and a new CONOPS developed during the NC3 Increment One, he said.\nOne of the attributes of the evolutionary approach to NC3 Next, Richard noted, is that STRATCOM can “iteratively move our way forward in a much faster update rate than you do with delivery platforms.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: Strategic Command (STRATCOM) “will have some very good news” to report to a Congress worried that the critical Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (NC3) network suffered cyber vulnerabilities, Adm.

{"title": "White House, DoT Promote More Dough For GPS Alternatives", "publish_time": "2021-01-20 12:00:52", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: No currently available commercial alternative can provide a stand-alone backup to GPS, concludes\na long-awaited study led by the Transportation Department.\nWhile some systems can stand in for GPS’s timing function, none provide robust enough positioning and navigation capabilities, the study concludes.\nThe study,\nComplementary PNT and GPS Backup Technologies Demonstration Report,\nwas released Friday — the same day the White House issued a new policy to improve GPS as well as kick-starting investment in alternative PNT systems.\nSpace Policy Directive 7 (SPD-7)\nreplaces the 2004 PNT policy issued by the George W. Bush administration. In particular, the directive focuses on the need for increased Pentagon focus on making GPS signals more jam resistant, as well as improving cybersecurity — such as the roll out of Lockheed Martin’s\nnext-generation GPS III satellites\nand full implementation of the\nlong-delayed M-Code\nencrypted signal.\nSPD-7 also contains new language urging US government agencies to “Invest in domestic capabilities and support international activities to detect, mitigate, and increase resilience to harmful disruption or manipulation of GPS, and identify and implement, as appropriate, alternative sources of PNT for critical infrastructure, key resources, and mission-essential functions.”\n“In my opinion, the focus on augmentation and non-space PNT alternatives is significant, as I think it symbolizes a shift away from the previous ‘gold standard’ approach of getting everyone to use and rely on GPS,” Brian Weeden, head of program planning for the Secure World Foundation said in an email yesterday.\n“The original goal of that gold standard approach was to undermine any foreign GNSS competitor, which didn’t work, and also conflicted with the DOD’s requirement to be able to deny GPS to adversaries,” he explained. “I think the latter is why we haven’t seen more effort put towards shoring up civil GPS signals against jamming and spoofing, and instead you see a policy shift to encourage alternative sources of PNT.”\nDoT reviewed 11 commercial available PNT systems, based on a variety of technologies, finding that “there are suitable, mature and commercially available technologies to backup or complement the timing services provided by GPS.” However, the study also found that “none of the systems can universally backup the positioning and navigations capabilities provided by GPS and its augmentations. The critical infrastructure positioning and navigation requirements are so varied that function, application, and end-user specific positioning and navigation solutions are needed. This necessitates a diverse universe of positioning and navigation technologies.”\nNonetheless, the study says the US government should promote use of currently available tech and investment in emerging capabilities “that show strong performance, operational diversity, operational readiness, and cost-effectiveness is worthwhile. Based on this demonstration, those technologies are LF [low frequency, with a range of 30–300 kHz] and UHF [ultra-high frequency, with a range of 300–3,000 MHz] terrestrial and L-band [1-2 GHz, and used by GPS] satellite broadcasts for PNT functions with supporting fiber optic time services to transmitters/control segments,” it finds.\nThe DoT study was mandated by Congress in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act.

Without better guidance on what government buyers want, it obviously is difficult for companies to commit internal research and development funds.\nThe DoT study, in fact, makes two recommendations aimed at its own future work to promote alternative PNT systems for use in the transportation sector, which relies heavily on GPS, that would go some way toward helping industry determine where to put its own money:\nDOT should develop system requirements for PNT functions that support safety-critical services.\nDOT should develop standards, test procedures, and monitoring capabilities to ensure that PNT services, and the equipage that utilizes them, meet the necessary levels of safety and resilience identified in Recommendation 1.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: No currently available commercial alternative can provide a stand-alone backup to GPS, concludes <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/06/sasc-wants-alternative-gps-by-2023/\">a long-awaited study led by the Transportation Department.</a> While some systems can stand in for GPS’s timing function, none provide robust enough positioning and navigation capabilities, the study concludes.</p>\n<p>The study, <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2021-01/FY%2718%20NDAA%20Section%201606%20DOT%20Report%20to%20Congress_Combinedv2_January%202021.pdf\">Complementary PNT and GPS Backup Technologies Demonstration Report,</a><a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2021-01/FY%2718%20NDAA%20Section%201606%20DOT%20Report%20to%20Congress_Combinedv2_January%202021.pdf\"> </a>was released Friday — the same day the White House issued a new policy to improve GPS as well as kick-starting investment in alternative PNT systems. <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-space-policy-directive-7/\">Space Policy Directive 7 (SPD-7)</a> replaces the 2004 PNT policy issued by the George W. Bush administration. In particular, the directive focuses on the need for increased  Pentagon focus on making GPS signals more jam resistant, as well as improving cybersecurity — such as the roll out of Lockheed Martin’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/gps-iii/\">next-generation GPS III satellites</a> and full implementation of the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/m-code/\">long-delayed M-Code</a> encrypted signal.</p>\n<p>SPD-7 also contains new language urging US government agencies to “Invest in domestic capabilities and support international activities to detect, mitigate, and increase resilience to harmful disruption or manipulation of GPS, and identify and implement, as appropriate, alternative sources of PNT for critical infrastructure, key resources, and mission-essential functions.”</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, the focus on augmentation and non-space PNT alternatives is significant, as I think it symbolizes a shift away from the previous ‘gold standard’ approach of getting everyone to use and rely on GPS,” Brian Weeden, head of program planning for the Secure World Foundation said in an email yesterday.</p>\n<p>“The original goal of that gold standard approach was to undermine any foreign GNSS competitor, which didn’t work, and also conflicted with the DOD’s requirement to be able to deny GPS to adversaries,” he explained. “I think the latter is why we haven’t seen more effort put towards shoring up civil GPS signals against jamming and spoofing, and instead you see a policy shift to encourage alternative sources of PNT.”</p>\n<p>DoT reviewed 11 commercial available PNT systems, based on a variety of technologies, finding that “there are suitable, mature and commercially available technologies to backup or complement the timing services provided by GPS.”  However, the study also found that “none of the systems can universally backup the positioning and navigations capabilities provided by GPS and its augmentations. The critical infrastructure positioning and navigation requirements are so varied that function, application, and end-user specific positioning and navigation solutions are needed. This necessitates a diverse universe of positioning and navigation technologies.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the study says the US government should promote use of currently available tech and investment in emerging capabilities “that show strong performance, operational diversity, operational readiness, and cost-effectiveness is worthwhile. Based on this demonstration, those technologies are LF [low frequency, with a range of 30–300 kHz] and UHF [ultra-high frequency, with a range of 300–3,000 MHz] terrestrial and L-band [1-2 GHz, and used by GPS] satellite broadcasts for PNT functions with supporting fiber optic time services to transmitters/control segments,” it finds.</p>\n<p>The DoT study was mandated by Congress in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act.

In the pilot projects now getting underway, he said, “we... are exploring, as part of some of these initial efforts, what the limits are and how far we can push to 5G technology to the tactical edge.”\nThe Defense Department has requested $449 million for 5G work in 2021. It has already announced two waves or “tranches” of pilot projects. Enabling 5G networks at US bases was one of the\ntop priorities set by former DoD Undersecretary for Research & Engineering Mike Griffin.\nSome $600 million of Tranche 1 awards\nwere\nannounced\nOct. 8. That covers one year of setup and two years of experimentation.\nThe first wave, said Evans, already involves “over three dozen contracts [with] prime contractors [and] over 100 total companies, over half of them non-traditional” – that is, commercial tech companies rather than longstanding defense contractors. At least one more major award is coming soon.\nTranche 1 covers six projects at five bases belonging to four armed services:\nHill Air Force Base\n: Nokia will build a testbed for five other companies to try out alternative approaches to\ndynamically sharing spectrum\nbetween military radars and 5G communications, two radically different uses. (Historically, radar pulses are so powerful they simply drown out any wireless signals on the same band). Finding a way to share frequencies with civilian users, instead of just\nhanding them over entirely to private firms\n, is crucial to military operations as civilian demands eat up ever more of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nJoint Base Lewis-McChord\n(Army & Air Force): Four firms will build 5G networks for virtual reality and augmented reality training at both McChord proper and the nearby Yakima training range, which can accommodate a fully Army brigade at a time. Using AR/VR for training, mission planning, and even tactical updates in combat is a major emphasis for Army modernization.\nMarine Corps Logistics Base Albany\n: This pilot will experiment with applying commercial “smart warehouse” systems to heavy Marine Corps vehicles, for example electronically monitoring the maintenance status and “health” of each truck.\nNaval Base San Diego\n: A second smart warehouse initiative, focused on Navy supplies being packaged for delivery to the fleet.\nNellis Air Force Base\n: Nellis, announced later than the others, will host two experiments, arguably the most ambitious.\nOne Nellis project seeks to apply 5G technology to the internal networks at a command center, allowing large HQs to downsize and decentralize to\nmultiple, smaller, harder-to-target sites\n. “You\nsplit up a Combined Air Operation Center and disperse it\nand then make it increasingly nomadic” – i.e. able to relocate – “then potentially increasingly mobile,” i.e. able to function on the move, Evans said. This experiment will use a commercial technology called Cell On Light Truck (COLT), which looks and functions somewhat like a TV news van.\nThe second Nellis project add various “network enhancements” to the 5G testbed. Evans said the winning contractors for this one would be selected “within the next couple of weeks.”\nIn\nJune\n, the Pentagon announced seven more sites,\nTranche 2.\nOne of the key goals for the second tranche is to test out spectrum sharing with the private sector;\nanother is incorporating “zero trust” security protocols. Those bases are:\nNaval Station Norfolk\n: 5G networks for both ship-to-pier coordination and internal communication within the ship.\nJoint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam\n(Navy & Air Force): “aircraft mission readiness.” This probably means digital tracking – and\nperhaps even predicting\n– the maintenance needs of each plane.\nJoint Base San Antonio\n(Air Force and Army): Two projects, one “to evaluate augmented reality support of maintenance and training,” the other to “evaluate DOD’s 5G core security experimentation network.”\nTinker Air Force Base\n: “bidirectional spectrum sharing, both in DOD and the commercial sector.” That sounds like another application of the same kind of technology being tested out at Hill AFB in Utah.\nFort Hood\n;\nNational Training Center\n/Fort Irwin\n; and\nMarine Corps Base Camp Pendleton\n: All three sites will explore “wireless connectivity for forward operating bases and tactical operations centers.” That sounds very similar to the work being done at Nellis on shrinking and splitting up HQs. However, here the focus is on frontline tactical units, not on theater command centers. This is an even more challenging environment for the civilian tech.\nFormal calls for white-paper proposals have already gone out for the three Navy and Marine Corps sites, Norfolk, Pearl Harbor, and Camp Pendleton. Here, the Pentagon is working with industry through a public-private consortium called the\nInformation Warfare Research Project\n(IWRP), which held an industry day for interested vendors last month.\nThe deadline to submit the white papers is still officially Nov. 15, Evans said, but enough companies have requested an extension that “we anticipate extending that ... a little further, probably into December.”\nOnce the government has reviewed the papers, it will use that industry feedback to refine its plans and put out a final solicitation in January or February, Evans said, with contract awards expected in the spring.\nContracts for the remaining four bases – the Army and Air Force sites: San Antonio, Tinker, Ft.

It is just trying to say that they did something,” said veteran space policy wonk Erin Neal, founder of Velocity Government Relations and staffer to former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida.\nSpace isn’t expected to have a high profile in the administration of incoming President Joe Biden, given the pandemic, the flailing economy, the climate crisis and a number of foreign policy challenges — many, such as the prickly relations between the US and its NATO allies, of the Trump administration’s own making. That said, Biden — like every other president before him — likely will eventually want to put his own stamp on space policy.\nFor example, the new Trump policy seeks to enshrine the role of the National Space Council, led by Vice President Mike Pence and used, in large part, as a bully pulpit for advocacy of administration decisions. But, word on the street is that while the Biden administration is unlikely to get rid of the council, given VP Kamala Harris’s lack of interest in the subject and the time sink it’s proven to be for agency heads the White House may simply let it languish.\nSimilarly, Biden isn’t expected to try to undo the creation of\nSpace Force,\nsince it was created with strong bi-partisan backing and is now enshrined in law. (\nAs Breaking D readers know,\nthe concept was originated in 2017 by Democrat Rep. Jim Cooper and Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, at the time the ranking member and chair of the House Armed Services Committee’s Strategic Forces subcommittee; Rogers has been elevated to HASC ranking member and Cooper chairs the Strategic Forces subcommittee.) Rather, independent policy experts expect the new administration to tone down Trump’s chest-thumping rhetoric on the need for US military space dominance while quietly going about efforts to beef up military space capabilities.\nAnd regarding NASA, observers are expecting a ratcheting back of the current emphasis on American ‘boots on the Moon’ in exchange for a keener focus (and more money) on Earth science and climate monitoring efforts that Trump tried unsuccessfully to cut. Indeed, the new Trump space policy strips all references to climate change that had been in past policies.\nIn reality, experts say, the new Trump policy doesn’t deviate that much from historical US approaches to space activities, including the most recent National Space Policy\nput out by President Barack Obama in 2010.\n“It largely repeats many of the same long-standing principles seen in previous national space policies,” said Secure World Foundation’s Brian Weeden. Secure World last week released a\npolicy guide for the incoming administration,\nwhich among other things calls for a greater emphasis on diplomacy.\nIn the national security realm, the Trump policy’s foot-stomping on space as a warfighting domain is an exception to historical precedence, although the pivot toward countering worrisome Chinese and Russian military space developments began under Obama.\nThe new policy also adds brand new and somewhat odd language on the need to couple classic deterrence with so-called “compellence.” Coined by legendary game theory pioneer and nuclear warfare strategist Thomas Schelling in 1966, the concept of compellence refers to taking direct action against adversaries to persuade them to give up actions deemed counter to one’s own interests. National security scholars have long argued over exactly what compellence means. For example, can economic sanctions compel, or does compellence require the use of provocative military moves to bring home to an adversary that it is vulnerable.\nThe new policy’s section on national security space states that the US must develop:\n“Synchronized diplomatic, information, military, and economic strategies that:\nDeter adversaries and other actors from conducting activities that may threaten\nthe peaceful use of space by the United States, its allies, and partners; and\nCompel and impose costs on adversaries to cease behaviors that threaten the\npeaceful use of space by the United States, its allies, and partners.”\nAt the same time, the policy explicitly charges the State Department to lead efforts at setting international norms of behavior and even to pursue arms control, with the usual caveats that treaties must be “equitable, effectively verifiable, and enhance the national security of the United States and its allies.”\nOther brand new policy language would codify US rights and intentions to pursue\nspace resource extraction,\nsuch as harvesting water from the Moon and\nrare earth minerals\nfrom asteroids — a policy that while somewhat controversial abroad, has enjoyed bipartisan backing in Congress.\nThe policy says: “The United States will pursue the extraction and utilization of space resources in compliance with applicable law, recognizing those resources as critical for sustainable exploration, scientific discovery, and commercial operations.”\nTrump administration insiders say the new Trump space policy was actually crafted quite carefully not to color too far outside traditional US lines, but at the same time to allow the administration to take a kind of victory lap. It also was partially aimed, sources say, at providing a last minute push to administration efforts during congressional conference deliberations on federal appropriations for DoD, NASA and the Commerce Department.\nFor example, the policy seeks to cement\nSpace Policy Directive-2\n(SPD-2) and\nSPD-3 into long-term US policy.\nSPD-2 set out a number of initiatives to de-regulate commercial space activities and sought to give the Commerce Department a larger role in that regulation. SPD-3 called for Commerce to take over from DoD the mission of providing space situational awareness (SSA) data to commercial companies and foreign entities. Congress has been less than willing to give Commerce the new authorities and provide the necessary funding, so this may be moot.\nThe new policy has been in the works for almost year. So, unlike some recent administration moves, observers say, it doesn’t have a whiff of revenge (think firing Defense Secretary Mark Esper), or deliberate obstruction of the incoming Biden team.\n“It was done through the normal inter-agency [process] with deputies committees, and all those other things,” one source said.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: Outgoing President Donald Trump has issued a new <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/National-Space-Policy.pdf\">National Space Policy</a> that, in essence, seeks to put an official stamp on the administration’s previous decisions, from asserting that space is a warfighting domain to pledging a permanent US presence on the Moon to supporting industry efforts to mine celestial bodies.</p>\n<p>The big question is: does it matter?</p>\n<p>“I just think it’s a little too late for trying to put a stamp on something.

{"title": "Eye On JADC2, Lockheed Explores Unique 5G-SATCOM Network", "publish_time": "2021-03-23 20:36:31", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: Lockheed Martin has joined forces with startup Omnispace to explore an innovative ‘hybrid’ communications network using both satellites and ground-based wireless tech.\n“[T]ying terrestrial and non-terrestrial together to make [connectivity] ubiquitous for a user makes a lot of sense. Omnispace’s vision provides provides that thought process as to how to get there, and how to do it cost effectively with what commercial solution sets are offering,” Clark VanBuskirk, vice president for advanced program development at Lockheed Martin Space said in an interview today.\nSpecifically, the defense behemoth is interested in tiny Omnispace’s software design, which would allow users with any 5G-capable device (i.e. a smart phone, etc.) to directly access the network, according to company officials. Indeed, the agreement with Omnispace was negotiated primarily by Lockheed Martin’s Missions Solutions Group, which focuses on software and ground systems, rather than by its space business.\nOther potential players in what is expected to be a billion-dollar market for space-based Internet and 5G communications — such as SpaceX, OneWeb and Telesat — require special ground equipment (such as dishes) to link to their satellites, Lockheed Martin and Omnispace officials explained.\nOmnispace’s direct-to-device system is based on current software standards for mobile communications (known as 3GPP) and standard hardware, said Jay Yass, chief corporate development officer.\n“That’s the key differentiation, I believe, to the other very large players — that we’re talking about directed- device using standard devices leveraging this large ecosystem of 3GPP, which is going to now be a 5G ecosystem of chipset and devices which are rolling out globally,” he said.\nIn addition, unlike many other would-be providers in orbits outside of Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO, where satellites match the Earth’s rotation and where traditional communications satellites operate), Omnispace already has a swath of spectrum sanctioned by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for global usage.\n“Omnispace has high priority S-band spectrum from the ICU that’s already been brought in to use, and we have licenses globally in many key countries,” Yass said. “And we believe that’s one of the key components of differentiation.”\nFrom Lockheed Martin’s perspective, the potential value is an ability provide DoD with 5G connectivity as a means to underpin\nAll Domain Operations\n, including the military’s envisioned\nJoint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2)\nconcept for managing complex, information-centric warfare in the air, land, sea, space and cyberspace domains simultaneously.\nJADC2 will require the services to easily access vast amounts of bandwidth and remain connected all around the globe. This includes\nremote areas such as the Arctic, where laying fiber optic cables for communications is nearly impossible\n— and where Russia and China already are jockeying for position as the waters there warm up enough to allow commercial and military exploitation of the region.\n“DoD is looking at the value that 5G can bring, and honestly what 5g from space can bring, and they’ve got a number of projects that are underway today to address those activities,” VanBuskirk said. “If you look at things like their\nInformation Warfare Research Project\nin 5G, they’re actually deploying pathfinders and prototypes at some of the bases in order to determine how to provide that support, and then, in the future, how to provide support to those expeditionary forces when you may not have terrestrial access — i.e., like in the Arctic or in a scenario where our warfighters may need to be somewhere on a Pacific island without having communications.”\nFor Omnispace, which launched in 2012 and is still raising venture capital, the partnership boosts its street cred with investors. Most recently,\nOmnispace last month raised $60 million\nfrom a group of investment firms led by Fortress Investment Group. The Virginia-based startup has one satellite, called F2, on orbit so far; in November it contracted with satellite rideshare provider Exolaunch to put up two satellites it bought from Franco-Italian firm Thales Alenia Space.\nThe partnership with Lockheed Martin also could help navigate the complicated US defense and government markets. According to Omnispace’s website, the initial focus for its 5G network concept has been the commercial ‘enterprise’ market for Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G access — that is, businesses such as long-haul trucking and agriculture where autonomous vehicles are already in use.\nIronically, Yass said, most of the Omnispace’s demos so far have been for the military: “Our current satellite has been used for proof of concept and pilots, and we focus them mostly on the military use up to now has dipped only one small toe into the US military arena.”\nOn March 15, the company announced a successful lab-based demo of its 5G connection capability for the US Navy and Marine Corps.\n“A number of commercial-off-the-shelf 5G devices successfully communicated voice and data services via an emulated 5G radio access network (RAN), to Omnispace’s on-orbit satellite, leveraging LinQuest Corporation’s lab facility in Northern Virginia,” the press release explained.\n“We’ve done a project with SMC [Space Force’s Space and Missile Command],” Yass added. “And we’ve done a couple of projects with the Marines globally, and some of them have been north of the Arctic Circle.”\nThe bilateral agreement does’t yet involve any commitment of funds, only a promise that the two would partner in any future related venture. “It’s sort of like we’re exclusively dating. We agreed to not see other people right now, but we haven’t committed to anything else yet,” explained one Lockheed Martin official.\nNeither VanBuskirk or Yass would talk about specific next steps, but said there is still a ways to go in figuring out the roadmap ahead.\nFor example, Yass said there is “work to be done” to determine the optimum satellite architecture to provide global coverage. Omnispace’s F2 orbits in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), but the two Thales Alena sats operate in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).\n“We’re still doing the trades on the NGSS, non-geostationary orbits, whether it’s LEO or MEO in the future to cover the globe — totally global from pole to pole — coverage across the oceans, including those Pacific Atolls,” he said.\nVanBuskirk said a key task is refining user needs and honing use cases where the hybrid network concept would provide optimal benefits.\n“So part of what we are doing is evaluating and getting feedback from the user communities, as to where do they see the needs that exist out there, and how can this vision address those needs,” he said.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: Lockheed Martin has joined forces with startup Omnispace to explore an innovative ‘hybrid’ communications network using both satellites and ground-based wireless tech.</p>\n<p>“[T]ying terrestrial and non-terrestrial together to make [connectivity] ubiquitous for a user makes a lot of sense.

This includes <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/03/afrl-northcom-eye-commercial-internet-sats-for-arctic/\">remote areas such as the Arctic, where laying fiber optic cables for communications is nearly impossible </a>— and where Russia and China already are jockeying for position as the waters there warm up enough to allow commercial and military exploitation of the region.</p>\n<p>“DoD is looking at the value that 5G can bring, and honestly what 5g from space can bring, and they’ve got a number of projects that are underway today to address those activities,” VanBuskirk said. “If you look at things like their <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/11/5g-experiments-may-lead-to-battlefield-applications-dod/\">Information Warfare Research Project</a> in 5G, they’re actually deploying pathfinders and prototypes at some of the bases in order to determine how to provide that support, and then, in the future, how to provide support to those expeditionary forces when you may not have terrestrial access — i.e., like in the Arctic or in a scenario where our warfighters may need to be somewhere on a Pacific island without having communications.”</p>\n<p>For Omnispace, which launched in 2012 and is still raising venture capital, the partnership boosts its street cred with investors. Most recently, <a href=\"https://omnispace.com/omnispace-continues-to-advance-the-development-of-its-global-5g-hybrid-mobile-network/\">Omnispace last month raised $60 million</a> from a group of investment firms led by Fortress Investment Group. The Virginia-based startup has one satellite, called F2, on orbit so far; in November it contracted with satellite rideshare provider Exolaunch to put up two satellites it bought from Franco-Italian firm Thales Alenia Space.</p>\n<p>The partnership with Lockheed Martin also could help navigate the complicated US defense and government markets. According to Omnispace’s website, the initial focus for its 5G network concept has been the commercial ‘enterprise’ market for Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G access — that is, businesses such as long-haul trucking and agriculture where autonomous vehicles are already in use.</p>\n<p>Ironically, Yass said, most of the Omnispace’s demos so far have been for the military: “Our current satellite has been used for proof of concept and pilots, and we focus them mostly on the military use up to now has dipped only one small toe into the US military arena.”</p>\n<a href=\"https://omnispace.com/omnispace-demonstrates-5g-satellite-capability-with-u-s-navy-marine-corps/\">On March 15, the company announced a successful lab-based demo of its 5G connection capability for the US Navy and Marine Corps.</a> “A number of commercial-off-the-shelf 5G devices successfully communicated voice and data services via an emulated 5G radio access network (RAN), to Omnispace’s on-orbit satellite, leveraging LinQuest Corporation’s lab facility in Northern Virginia,” the press release explained.\n<p>“We’ve done a project with SMC [Space Force’s Space and Missile Command],” Yass added. “And we’ve done a couple of projects with the Marines globally, and some of them have been north of the Arctic Circle.”</p>\n<p>The bilateral agreement does’t yet involve any commitment of funds, only a promise that the two would partner in any future related venture. “It’s sort of like we’re exclusively dating. We agreed to not see other people right now, but we haven’t committed to anything else yet,” explained one Lockheed Martin official.</p>\n<p>Neither VanBuskirk or Yass would talk about specific next steps, but said there is still a ways to go in figuring out the roadmap ahead.</p>\n<p>For example, Yass said there is “work to be done” to determine the optimum satellite architecture to provide global coverage. Omnispace’s F2 orbits in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), but the two Thales Alena sats operate in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).</p>\n<p>“We’re still doing the trades on the NGSS, non-geostationary orbits, whether it’s LEO or MEO in the future to cover the globe — totally global from pole to pole — coverage across the oceans, including those Pacific Atolls,” he said.</p>\n<p>VanBuskirk said a key task is refining user needs and honing use cases where the hybrid network concept would provide optimal benefits.</p>\n<p>“So part of what we are doing is evaluating and getting feedback from the user communities, as to where do they see the needs that exist out there, and how can this vision address those needs,” he said.</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["5G", "5G networks", "All Domain Operations", "arctic", "commercial satellite communications", "Exolaunch", "Information Warfare Research Project", "internet of things", "LinQuest", "Lockheed Martin Corp", "Marine Corps", "navy", "Omnispace", "OneWeb", "SpaceX", "Telesat", "Thales Alenia Space", "venture capital"], "categories": [], "img_data": [{"img_url": "https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-23-at-11.43.08-AM.png", "img_describe": "Omnispace is pioneering a ‘hybrid’ 5G network using satellites and terrestrial wireless tech", "img_name": "news/img_2021_07_21_60f798d1435cc49f1f88d6f9.png"}], "video_data": [], "url": "https://breakingdefense.com/2021/03/eye-on-jadc2-lockheed-explores-unique-5g-satcom-network/", "site_name": "breakingdefense", "insert_time": "2021-07-21 11:47:29"}

{"title": "Exclusive: Army Plan May Loosen IC Grip On Sat-Based ISR", "publish_time": "2021-05-04 11:00:05", "author": ["Theresa HitchensSydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: The Army is negotiating with the Intelligence Community and Space Force about ensuring operational control of any future Army-built ISR payloads hosted on DoD, IC and/or commercial satellites, says Willie Nelson, the de facto head of Army space programs.\n“This is a watershed,” said Doug Loverro, former head of DoD space policy and a long-time player in space intelligence operations. “It represents the increased importance of tactical overhead support to Army forces for long range fires.”\nWhy? If the service wins even a modicum of control over where future IC ISR birds are ‘pointed’ — a prerogative the IC traditionally has zealously guarded — it would represent a major break with the past.\nFor decades, a small committee has made the decisions about where America’s spy satellites are tasked and who gets priority access to their data steams. Today, that committee is led by the director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), which sets the operational requirements for the NRO to meet when it builds spy sats — as well as for\nany commercial ISR sat data contracted for by NRO.\nNGA, in effect, also has its finger on the trigger as to who gets priority for the data streaming from those satellites.\nThe Army doesn’t want to totally take over the steering wheel of NRO-operated imagery or signals intelligence satellites, or (at least for the moment) build its own constellation of ISR sats. Instead, Nelson explains, it is focused on ensuring that ISR (or any other) payloads it might build in future for hosting on non-Army satellites will be available when the service needs them.\nOne of the Army’s end-goals with its multi-pronged Tactical Satellite Layer (TSL) experiment is to ensure “dedicated” access to space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data needed to guide missiles to targets deep inside Chinese and/or Russian territory, Nelson told Sydney in an interview. Those\nlong-range precision fire capabilities\nare one of the Army’s top priorities, as they are considered by service leaders to be the linch-pin for future\nall-domain operations.\nArmy requirements, he stressed, are to “sense deep, engage deep, target deep.”\nThe Army wants a “cooperative relationship” where ISR constellations of small satellites are managed day-to-day and launched by the traditional milspace operators, Nelson said.\nThis includes the\nNRO,\nand the Space Development Agency (SDA) that is working on a constellation of small satellites for communications and another for missile tracking. SDA, in turn, is\nexpected to soon come under Space Force\nhead Gen. Jay Raymond as part of a reorganization of\nSpace and Missile Systems Center\ninto a new\nSpace Systems Command.\n“We are doing this working with the Space Force and SDA and the Intelligence Community,” Nelson explained.\nOn the other hand, he stressed, the Army wants to be “tied at the hip” in the process for establishing how data is distributed and to be “able to directly reach out and touch and task those capabilities deliberately” rather than in an “ad hoc manner” or under a priority list made by someone outside the Army. The requirement, he said, is for “dedicated capacity, so that it is there when it’s needed.”\nBattlefield Needs Vs. Strategic Needs\nThe Army’s campaign to ensure 24/7 access to space-based ISR data dates back all the way to Desert Storm in 1991, explain experts inside and outside of DoD. For nigh on 30 years, military users have complained bitterly that NRO and NGA don’t always meet commanders’ needs for near-real time battlefield ISR for targeting enemy assets.\n“There has been a longstanding concern among DoD users of space-based ISR: will the IC be there for me when I need them? Trust has to be built,” said one former DoD official.\nOne longstanding attempt to ameliorate this disconnect has been the military services’\nTactical Exploitation of National Capabilities Program (TENCAP).\nKeith Masback, once the Army’s director of ISR Integration, explained that “the TENCAP approach is a cooperative effort between the IC and DoD to build deployable systems that facilitate more rapid dissemination of data from national space assets to tactical forces.” But, he added: “While those investments do accelerate delivery, they don’t get at the larger issue of the prioritization of tasking the assets.”\nBattlefield needs, commanders have consistently argued, always are susceptible to being out-competed by the strategic intelligence (e.g. nuclear-related) priorities of the IC, the president and even the State Department.\nThe IC argues that those assets — imagery satellites, radar satellites, signals intelligence satellites — are needed by numerous customers, who in turn have different concerns. Space-based ISR has\nbeen a limited resource\nbecause ISR satellites have been enormously expensive to build, and relatively few and far between. The job of the NGA-led committee, therefore, has been essentially to perform triage among an ever-more needy user base.\nMasback, who was once chairman of the tasking committee, understands both sides of this challenge. “Warfighting commanders are unwavering and unambiguous regarding their need for assured access to ISR. The military services maintain organic ISR to meet their respective doctrinal needs, but the deep strike mission has always been vexing as it creates a reliance on national-level space assets. ‘Forces in contact’ always get the highest priority, but there is a need to timely respond to high-interest strategic requirements as well. It’s a carefully orchestrated 24/7/365 balancing act that isn’t necessarily prepared to support targeting, battle damage assessment, and re-strike at the speed of hypersonics.”\nAt the same time, the need for up-to-the-minute, on-demand ISR has become even more important to the Army\nbecause\nof its plans for\nhypersonic missiles\nand\nother long-range weapons.\nThey simply will not be usable without near real-time information about targets for them to hit. While drones have been providing the Army and other services on-demand ISR for years, they are increasingly at risk from\nadversary anti-aircraft capabilities.\n“The services have grown used to having that kind of overhead reconnaissance at their beck and call, but they know that all the fights in the future will not be in such a permissive air environment to allow small mobile UAVs to support their needs. And, as the range of fires increase, and the pace of combat quickens, you need to extend that range through space. So small tactical satellites ‘controlled by local commanders’ are the answer,” Loverro said.\nRob Zitz, a former senior government official who held leadership roles in Army Intelligence, NRO and NGA, was much more blunt. “The Army simply cannot wait for approvals from the IC to prioritize their needs when minutes matter,” he told me in an email. “The Army needs information when and where they want it. The IC should not get a vote on what Army needs or how Army executes combat missions.”\nMore Suppliers, More Options\nIn recent years, technologies to push down the size, weight and power demands for components, along with rapidly declining costs of launch, have spurred a boom in commercial satellite operators specializing in high-fidelity imagery, radar and even RF-tracking satellites.\nIndeed, the IC and DoD have been trying to figure out how best to tap into those commercial capabilities. This includes directly buying\ndata and/or services;\nefforts now being\npursued by the IC via an NGA council.\nIt also includes working with commercial firms to adopt and adapt their kit and capabilities; part of the SDA’s strategy for building its\nNational Defense Space Architecture\n. The Space Force, meanwhile,\nnow says it too is considering buying commercial ISR services\nto improve warfighter access.\nThe ongoing proliferation of satellite technologies opens the door for the natsec community to consider new ways to improve exploitation of space-based ISR, former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Kari Bingen told me in an email.\n“DoD and the IC now have a great opportunity to experiment — as the National Defense Strategy says — with different models for tasking, different pathways for distributing satellite data,” said Bingen, who recently joined commercial RF geolocation sat firm Hawkeye 360. “If the Army, NRO and NGA are all coming to the table to discuss in good faith — that’s a great development. It’s a first step, but a good thing.”\nIt also, several insiders said, gives Army brass a lot more ammunition to push the IC on the issue than they have had in the past.\n“The legacy tasking model of ‘one control’ over everything is being stressed. And given DoD’s challenges in meeting its changing ISR needs, it’s arguably not the right approach going forward — it’s inefficient,” one former DoD official explained.\nFrom Kestrel Eye to Hosted Payloads\nThe Army has experimented with developing its own micro-satellites to provide ISR, most notably with the\nKestrel Eye project\ninitiated in 2007. Kestrel Eye, a mini-fridge sized electro-optical satellite with a two-meter resolution, was launched in 2017 and operated for 10 months.\nAccording to an undated Army Space and Missile Defense Command fact sheet,\na Military Utility Assessment (MUA) “was conducted at U.S. Pacific Command” and resulted in two major findings: that Kestral Eye “successfully provided rapid imagery directly from the satellite to the tactical ground station;” and “the overall assessment conclusion recommending further development of the system to fully demonstrate its readiness to be a program of record.”\nThat did not happen. Instead, the Army approved a strategy\n“to demonstrate” obtaining tactical ISR (as well as communications capabilities)\nfrom Low Earth Orbit satellite constellations by “leveraging” DARPA’s Blackjack program and commercial capabilities.\nFast forward to today, where the Army is working with SDA to both host payloads and develop\na ground station, TITAN,\nto link to\nSDA’s Transport Layer\nof communications/data relay sats. (Meanwhile,\nthe SDA and NRO are discussing\nhow spy sats might directly link with\nSDA’s planned Transport Layer\nof data relay sats as one option speeding imagery to warfighters for use in targeting.)\nIndeed, the service’s current Tactical Space Layer experimentation program was established sometime in 2019, according to\nan Army press release,\nunder an Interagency Memorandum of Agreement among the Army, NRO, NGA and DIA.\nHow and why that change happened isn’t documented anywhere that we could find. But there have been plenty of rumors floating around that when the Army finally got serious about building its own satellites, NRO and NGA weighed in to argue that this would be inefficient. Thus, they put the kibosh on the service’s plans. In other words, the current Army approach could be seen as a politically savvy fall-back position designed to tack around bureaucratic obstacles.\nIn any event, Nelson and other Army officials insist nowadays that the service\nhas no plans to buy, own and operate satellites.\nRather, the TSL concept, being spearhead by the Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing/Space (APNT/Space) Cross-Functional Team (CFT) that Nelson leads, is aimed\nat prototyping sensor payloads\n— and it is not even yet a program of record at all.\nThose experimental payloads are largely focused on ISR capabilities, but also on alternatives to GPS for positioning, navigation and timing (PNT).\n“Expanding U.S Army access to space-based capabilities will allow deep sensing in contested operational environments to enable responsive and accurate long-range precision fires, provide resilient communications, and assured PNT,” an Army spokesperson said in an email.\nTSL Experiments\nThe Army on April 19 announced it had approved an Abbreviated Capability Development Document (A-CDD)\nthat details service requirements, and allows rapid prototyping and experimentation through DoD’s Middle Tier Acquisition process.\n“The A-CDD supports the development of Tactical Space Layer prototyping capabilities and solutions that will enable deep-sensing, targeting, artificial intelligence / machine learning, positioning, navigation and timing, and tactical communications to shorten sensor to shooter timelines,” the Army spokesperson explained.\n“Funding provided will support FY21-23 development of prototypes and experimentation in coordination with the Intelligence Community, the Space Development Agency and US Space Force,” the spokesperson continued. However, how much funding is still in flux as the Army massages 2021 and future year budgets.\nThe TSL includes at least three ongoing Army efforts to build experimental satellites/payloads:\nGunsmoke, Lonestar and Polaris.\nThe first Gunsmoke, a tiny Cubesat called Gunsmoke-L, was launched Feb. 20; the second, Gunsmoke-J, on March 31. A third should be launched soon,\nan Army press release says.\nGunsmoke has been developed with support from DoD’s Office of the Undersecretary of Research & Engineering, under a contract with Dynetics, a subsidiary of Leidos.\nLonestar is designed to warn commanders about GPS jamming on the battlefield and to characterize the signals environment in a contested area so that the Army can overcome the problem and operate effectively. Dynetics also is the prime, and it delivered two “tactical space support vehicles” under the project in July 2020; launch is expected something this year.\nPolaris also is aimed at APNT, but its primary goal is to provide an alternative to traditional space-based GPS in contested battle spaces.\nAccording to Tom Webber,\nhead of SMDC’s Technical Center who is charged with the effort, the Army sees Polaris as a possible payload on SDA’s Transport Layer.\nLooming Space Force Food Fight\nThe Army’s hopes for ‘organic’ space-based capabilities may face another hurdle going forward besides breaking away from the IC — competition with the Space Force. The newest branch of the military did not exist when the Army was transitioning from Kestrel Eye to TSL.\nA number of sources inside and outside DoD say that Space Force leaders have been casting covetous eyes on\nall\nspace acquisition programs, from satellite communications to ISR to missile warning and tracking — perhaps even hoping to\nsubsume NRO\nand the\nMissile Defense Agency.\nAs noted, it also is seeking to expand its mandate to provide commercial satellite communications to DoD users to include remote sensing, PNT and ISR,\nSpace Force Deputy Lt. Gen. DT Thompson recently said.\nDave Deputa, dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, yesterday questioned Space Force’s Maj. Gen. DeAnna Burt about whether the Army is overstepping Space Force bounds with its TSL effort.\n“When we go to a fight, it’s a joint fight, and so it’s a Joint Task Force Commander that’s doing the work,” he said during a virtual interview with Burt. “I mean the Air Force doesn’t have its own organic constellation of satellites to do strike targeting and planning … and the question is, why does the United States Army, as a separate service, need to have its own organic constellation?”\nBurt — who wears two hats: as head of Space Command’s Combined Force Space Component Command (CFSCC); and deputy commander of Space Force’s Space Operations Command — downplayed any potential rivalry, however. She explained that the 1947 Key West agreement creating the Air Force didn’t result in the other service’s giving up planes — instead there are a variety of aircraft dedicated to their specific needs.\n“So, I would say the same in the Space Force. We’re trying to find that balance of what space capabilities need to be retained with maneuver forces, and to protect the force, versus what are the things that are purely in the domain, or have a global effect or impact global combatant commanders, that need to be in the Space Force. So, that’s been the dialogue that’s ongoing.”\nThis includes, she said, LEO-based satellite constellations that the Army is interested in.\nThat said, she stressed that the use of any such service-specific space capabilities would “need to be coordinated and be deconflicted with US Space Command.” The goal, she said, “is to figure out how to bring it together, to synchronize across the enterprise. … and then, how do we command and control and orchestrate those so that they are not either fratting [i.e. engaging in fratricide] each other, or we’re double tapping targets if we don’t need to.”\nBurt also said that with regards to IC assets, Space Command is working every day via the\nNational Space Defense Center (NSDC)\nto coordinate on command and control — including when Space Command might need to take over to protect those assets. She explained that NSDC “has the lion’s share” of the responsibility for coordinating with the NRO, NGA and other IC agencies on how to best bring “intelligence capabilities to the protect and defend mission.”\nMasback also believes that the Army and other service needs will ultimately best be served by a networked, hybrid approach. “The services will need to integrate their organic ISR assets while leveraging those of their joint and combined partners, as well as creating agile streamlined access to traditional national space assets, the new SDA architecture, hosted payloads, and commercial capabilities to ensure that they can support their respective operational warfighting requirements. This will be their optimal pathway to timely, assured access to ISR.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The Army is negotiating with the Intelligence Community and Space Force about ensuring operational control of any future Army-built ISR payloads hosted on DoD, IC and/or commercial satellites, says Willie Nelson, the de facto head of Army space programs.</p>\n<p>“This is a watershed,” said Doug Loverro, former head of DoD space policy and a long-time player in space intelligence operations. “It represents the increased importance of tactical overhead support to Army forces for long range fires.”</p>\n<p>Why? If the service wins even a modicum of control over where future IC ISR birds are ‘pointed’ — a prerogative the IC traditionally has zealously guarded — it would represent a major break with the past.</p>\n<p>For decades, a small committee has made the decisions about where America’s spy satellites are tasked and who gets priority access to their data steams. Today, that committee is led by the director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), which sets the operational requirements for the NRO to meet when it builds spy sats — as well as for <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/07/senate-ndaa-mandates-nro-to-maximize-commercial-imagery-use/\">any commercial ISR sat data contracted for by NRO.</a> NGA, in effect, also has its finger on the trigger as to who gets priority for the data streaming from those satellites.</p>\n<p>The Army doesn’t want to totally take over the steering wheel of NRO-operated imagery or signals intelligence satellites, or (at least for the moment) build its own constellation of ISR sats. Instead, Nelson explains, it is focused on ensuring that ISR (or any other) payloads it might build in future for hosting on non-Army satellites will be available when the service needs them.</p>\n<p>One of the Army’s end-goals with its multi-pronged Tactical Satellite Layer (TSL) experiment is to ensure “dedicated” access to space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data needed to guide missiles to targets deep inside Chinese and/or Russian territory, Nelson told Sydney in an interview. Those <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/long-range-precision-fires/\">long-range precision fire capabilities</a> are one of the Army’s top priorities, as they are considered by service leaders to be the linch-pin for future <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/all-domain-operations/\">all-domain operations.</a></p>\n<p>Army requirements, he stressed, are to “sense deep, engage deep, target deep.”</p>\n<p>The Army wants a “cooperative relationship” where ISR constellations of small satellites are managed day-to-day and launched by the traditional milspace operators, Nelson said.</p>\n<p>This includes the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/national-reconnaissance-office/\">NRO,</a> and the Space Development Agency (SDA) that is working on a constellation of small satellites for communications and another for missile tracking. SDA, in turn, is <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/smc-revamp-sidesteps-hills-space-acquisition-worries/\">expected to soon come under Space Force</a> head Gen. Jay Raymond as part of a reorganization of <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/space-and-missile-systems-center/\">Space and Missile Systems Center</a> into a new <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/space-systems-command/\">Space Systems Command.  </a></p>\n<p>“We are doing this working with the Space Force and SDA and the Intelligence Community,” Nelson explained.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, he stressed, the Army wants to be “tied at the hip” in the process for establishing how data is distributed and to be “able to directly reach out and touch and task those capabilities deliberately” rather than in an “ad hoc manner” or under a priority list made by someone outside the Army. The requirement, he said, is for “dedicated capacity, so that it is there when it’s needed.”</p>\n<p>Battlefield Needs Vs. Strategic Needs</p>\n<p>The Army’s campaign to ensure 24/7 access to space-based ISR data dates back all the way to Desert Storm in 1991, explain experts inside and outside of DoD. For nigh on 30 years, military users have complained bitterly that NRO and NGA don’t always meet commanders’ needs for near-real time battlefield ISR for targeting enemy assets.</p>\n<p>“There has been a longstanding concern among DoD users of space-based ISR: will the IC be there for me when I need them? Trust has to be built,” said one former DoD official.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-153914 alignright\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-03-at-9.17.18-PM-300x245.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"245\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-03-at-9.17.18-PM-300x245.png 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-03-at-9.17.18-PM-210x172.png 210w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-03-at-9.17.18-PM.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"/>One longstanding attempt to ameliorate this disconnect has been the military services’ <a href=\"http://Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing/Space (APNT/Space) Cross-Functional Team (CFT)\">Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities Program (TENCAP).</a> Keith Masback, once the Army’s director of ISR Integration, explained that “the TENCAP approach is a cooperative effort between the IC and DoD to build deployable systems that facilitate more rapid dissemination of data from national space assets to tactical forces.” But, he added: “While those investments do accelerate delivery, they don’t get at the larger issue of the prioritization of tasking the assets.”</p>\n<p>Battlefield needs, commanders have consistently argued, always are susceptible to being out-competed by the strategic intelligence (e.g. nuclear-related) priorities of the IC, the president and even the State Department.</p>\n<p>The IC argues that those assets — imagery satellites, radar satellites, signals intelligence satellites — are needed by numerous customers, who in turn have different concerns. Space-based ISR has <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/06/industry-worries-friction-twixt-nro-nga-on-commercial-imagery/\">been a limited resource </a>because ISR satellites have been enormously expensive to build, and relatively few and far between. The job of the NGA-led committee, therefore, has been essentially to perform triage among an ever-more needy user base.</p>\n<p>Masback, who was once chairman of the tasking committee, understands both sides of this challenge. “Warfighting commanders are unwavering and unambiguous regarding their need for assured access to ISR. The military services maintain organic ISR to meet their respective doctrinal needs, but the deep strike mission has always been vexing as it creates a reliance on national-level space assets. ‘Forces in contact’ always get the highest priority, but there is a need to timely respond to high-interest strategic requirements as well. It’s a carefully orchestrated 24/7/365 balancing act that isn’t necessarily prepared to support targeting, battle damage assessment, and re-strike at the speed of hypersonics.”</p>\n<p>At the same time, the need for up-to-the-minute, on-demand ISR has become even more important to the Army <em>because</em> of its plans for <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/long-range-hypersonic-weapon/\">hypersonic missiles</a> and <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/long-range-precision-fires/\">other long-range weapons.</a> They simply will not be usable without near real-time information about targets for them to hit. While drones have been providing the Army and other services on-demand ISR for years, they are increasingly at risk from <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/anti-access-area-denial/\">adversary anti-aircraft capabilities.</a></p>\n<p>“The services have grown used to having that kind of overhead reconnaissance at their beck and call, but they know that all the fights in the future will not be in such a permissive air environment to allow small mobile UAVs to support their needs. And, as the range of fires increase, and the pace of combat quickens, you need to extend that range through space. So small tactical satellites ‘controlled by local commanders’ are the answer,” Loverro said.</p>\n<p>Rob Zitz, a former senior government official who held leadership roles in Army Intelligence, NRO and NGA, was much more blunt. “The Army simply cannot wait for approvals from the IC to prioritize their needs when minutes matter,” he told me in an email. “The Army needs information when and where they want it. The IC should not get a vote on what Army needs or how Army executes combat missions.”</p>\n<p>More Suppliers, More Options</p>\n<p>In recent years, technologies to push down the size, weight and power demands for components, along with rapidly declining costs of launch, have spurred a boom in commercial satellite operators specializing in high-fidelity imagery, radar and even RF-tracking satellites.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the IC and DoD have been trying to figure out how best to tap into those commercial capabilities. This includes directly buying <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/commercial-satellite-imagery/\">data and/or services;</a> efforts now being <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/01/new-ic-commercial-space-council-hopes-to-speed-intel-to-users/\">pursued by the IC via an NGA council.</a> It also includes working with commercial firms to adopt and adapt their kit and capabilities; part of the SDA’s strategy for building its <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/national-defense-space-architecture/\">National Defense Space Architecture</a>. The Space Force, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/space-force-eyes-buying-commercial-satellite-isr/\">now says it too is considering buying commercial ISR services</a> to improve warfighter access.</p>\n<p>The ongoing proliferation of satellite technologies opens the door for the natsec community to consider new ways to improve exploitation of space-based ISR, former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Kari Bingen told me in an email.</p>\n<p>“DoD and the IC now have a great opportunity to experiment — as the National Defense Strategy says — with different models for tasking, different pathways for distributing satellite data,” said Bingen, who recently joined commercial RF geolocation sat firm Hawkeye 360. “If the Army, NRO and NGA are all coming to the table to discuss in good faith — that’s a great development. It’s a first step, but a good thing.”</p>\n<p>It also, several insiders said, gives Army brass a lot more ammunition to push the IC on the issue than they have had in the past.</p>\n<p>“The legacy tasking model of ‘one control’ over everything is being stressed. And given DoD’s challenges in meeting its changing ISR needs, it’s arguably not the right approach going forward — it’s inefficient,” one former DoD official explained.</p>\n<p>From Kestrel Eye to Hosted Payloads</p>\n<p>The Army has experimented with developing its own micro-satellites to provide ISR, most notably with the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/08/army-seeks-small-satellites-to-support-ground-troops/\">Kestrel Eye project</a> initiated in 2007. Kestrel Eye, a mini-fridge sized electro-optical satellite with a two-meter resolution, was launched in 2017 and operated for 10 months.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.smdc.army.mil/Portals/38/Documents/Publications/Fact_Sheets/KestrelEye.pdf\">According to an undated Army Space and Missile Defense Command fact sheet, </a>a Military Utility Assessment (MUA) “was conducted at U.S. Pacific Command” and resulted in two major findings: that Kestral Eye “successfully provided rapid imagery directly from the satellite to the tactical ground station;” and “the overall assessment conclusion recommending further development of the system to fully demonstrate its readiness to be a program of record.”\n<p>That did not happen. Instead, the Army approved a strategy <a href=\"https://www.smdc.army.mil/Portals/38/Documents/Publications/Fact_Sheets/LEO_Strategy.pdf\">“to demonstrate” obtaining tactical ISR (as well as communications capabilities) </a>from Low Earth Orbit satellite constellations by “leveraging” DARPA’s Blackjack program and commercial capabilities.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to today, where the Army is working with SDA to both host payloads and develop <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/titan/\">a ground station, TITAN,</a> to link to <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/transport-layer/\">SDA’s Transport Layer</a> of communications/data relay sats. (Meanwhile,<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/02/exclusive-sda-nro-mull-direct-satellite-links-to-speed-imagery-to-warfighters/\"> the SDA and NRO are discussing</a> how spy sats might directly link with <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/transport-layer/\">SDA’s planned Transport Layer</a> of data relay sats as one option speeding imagery to warfighters for use in targeting.)</p>\n<p>Indeed, the service’s current Tactical Space Layer experimentation program was established sometime in 2019, according to <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/245465/u_s_army_approves_rapid_development_delivery_of_tactical_space_layer\">an Army press release,</a> under an Interagency Memorandum of Agreement among the Army, NRO, NGA and DIA.</p>\n<p>How and why that change happened isn’t documented anywhere that we could find. But there have been plenty of rumors floating around that when the Army finally got serious about building its own satellites, NRO and NGA weighed in to argue that this would be inefficient. Thus, they put the kibosh on the service’s plans. In other words, the current Army approach could be seen as a politically savvy fall-back position designed to tack around bureaucratic obstacles.</p>\n<p>In any event, Nelson and other Army officials insist nowadays that the service <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/03/army-wont-build-recon-satellites-lt-gen-berrier/\">has no plans to buy, own and operate satellites. </a></p>\n<p>Rather, the TSL concept, being spearhead by the Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing/Space (APNT/Space) Cross-Functional Team (CFT) that Nelson leads, is aimed <em>at prototyping sensor payloads</em> — and it is not even yet a program of record at all.</p>\n<p>Those experimental payloads are largely focused on ISR capabilities, but also on alternatives to GPS for positioning, navigation and timing (PNT).</p>\n<p>“Expanding U.S Army access to space-based capabilities will allow deep sensing in contested operational environments to enable responsive and accurate long-range precision fires, provide resilient communications, and assured PNT,” an Army spokesperson said in an email.</p>\n<p>TSL Experiments</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/245465/u_s_army_approves_rapid_development_delivery_of_tactical_space_layer\">The Army on April 19 announced it had approved an Abbreviated Capability Development Document (A-CDD)</a> that details service requirements, and allows rapid prototyping and experimentation through DoD’s Middle Tier Acquisition process.\n<p>“The A-CDD supports the development of Tactical Space Layer prototyping capabilities and solutions that will enable deep-sensing, targeting, artificial intelligence / machine learning, positioning, navigation and timing, and tactical communications to shorten sensor to shooter timelines,” the Army spokesperson explained.</p>\n<p>“Funding provided will support FY21-23 development of prototypes and experimentation in coordination with the Intelligence Community, the Space Development Agency and US Space Force,” the spokesperson continued. However, how much funding is still in flux as the Army massages 2021 and future year budgets.</p>\n<p>The TSL includes at least three ongoing Army efforts to build experimental satellites/payloads: <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/10/smdc-pushes-for-new-pnt-tracking-sat-payloads/\">Gunsmoke, Lonestar and Polaris.</a></p>\n<p>The first Gunsmoke, a tiny Cubesat called Gunsmoke-L, was launched Feb. 20; the second, Gunsmoke-J, on March 31.

{"title": "Skyborg Could Develop Multiple Drones For Many Missions", "publish_time": "2021-02-04 19:04:03", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: The high-priority\nSkyborg program\nto develop low-cost, autonomous drones able to team with piloted aircraft could reach initial operating capability by 2023, says AFRL Director Brig. Gen. Heather Pringle.\n“I’m really excited about what Skyborg has accomplished, and what we have in store,” she told the Mitchell Institute today, noting that her Air Force Research Laboratory is partnering with the PEO for fighters and advanced weapons led by Brig. Gen. Dale White. “We’re really excited about that December demo because it was a first-ever kind of opportunity to show an ‘attritable’ as a force multiplier with fifth-gen aircraft.”\nIOC, she said, is expected in 2023.\nPringle explained that\nwhile the Dec. 9 test wasn’t fully successful\n, it was incredibly useful from a research perspective. “We weren’t able to establish it in flight with the onboard communication gateway, but we still achieved achieved the objective, because we had a backup on the ground. And so the connections were made; we still got the job done.”\nLt. Col. Kate Stowe, gatewayONE program manager at the Air Force Lifecycle Management Center (AFLMC),\nsaid in a December press release\nthat the test had 18 test objectives and successfully achieved nine.\nThe test involved flying\ngatewayONE\non the\nXQ-58A Valkyrie\n(now dubbed “attribableONE” by the Air Force and made by Kratos) to ‘translate’ between the incompatible machine codes of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the F-22 Raptor.(‘Attritable’ is a made-up Air Force term for low-cost — but not quite throw-away’ — drones that the service can afford to lose in combat.)\nGatewayONE — essentially a radio and antenna system put together by Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Honeywell — has been specifically developed under the service’s pivotal\nAdvanced Battle Management System (ABMS)\nto provide that translation. But it was unable to properly connect during the December test at Yuma Proving Grounds in Arizona, thus a ground-based backup,\nproven in an earlier ABMS On-Ramp demo\n, was used instead.\nPringle explained that the Skyborg program, one of three\nAFRL Vanguard\nprograms for rushing new capability to the field, has three parts: the low-cost drone; the “autonomous core system” serving as the drone’s ‘brain;’ and the on-going experiment campaign. Next steps will be more tests this year, she added, involving “multiple prototypes.”\nAFLMC, the contracting agent for Skyborg,\nannounced 24-month contracts for three competitors:\nBoeing, for $25.7 million; General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc., for $14.3 million; and Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems Inc., for $37.8 million. AFRL said the next round of flight tests would take place this July.\nPringle noted that a key objective for the Skyborg program is keeping an “open architecture, and as much government data rights as we can get.” Another aim is to “allow the flexibility to adapt what Skyborg will be for the warfighters, and I think that will be an important part of the operational experimentation campaign.”\nShe explained that the goal is to test out how the three prototypes might undertake different missions, such as “comms relays, weapons delivery or any number of things they would want to use that trainable system.”\nGolden Horde\nIn her wide-ranging discussion, Pringle also addressed the status of another of AFRL’s ongoing Vanguards, the\nGolden Horde\nproject designed to develop new ‘swarming’ munitions equipped with data links to communicate, chose targets (based on pre-programmed algorithms) and coordinate strikes against an array of targets, independently from the human pilot. That project, too,\ndidn’t meet all of its objectives in its latest test, held Dec. 15.\n“It was another great learning opportunity,” Pringle said. “On the positive side, nine of 13 test objectives were met — things like the network radios were working, as well as the inter-swarm communications … But, not everything went according to plan.”\nAFRL and its partner in the program, the Weapons PEO led by Brig. Gen. Heath Collins, are “still doing the analysis,” Pringle said. “We’re looking forward to two more flights this month, in fact, with four\nCollaborative Small Diameter Bomb\nweapons and and looking at time on targets to try and up the game a little bit.”\nShe added that she and Collins “have been reassessing what the overall long term scope is of this program, and what the end deliverable will be. A major component of that is building a digital architecture that will allow more testing of various kinds of collaborative technologies, and building in some containerized [software] solutions that could be more plug-and-play across weapons.

Gen. Heather Pringle.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited about what Skyborg has accomplished, and what we have in store,” she told the Mitchell Institute today, noting that her Air Force Research Laboratory is partnering with the PEO for fighters and advanced weapons led by Brig. Gen. Dale White. “We’re really excited about that December demo because it was a first-ever kind of opportunity to show an ‘attritable’ as a force multiplier with fifth-gen aircraft.”</p>\n<p>IOC, she said, is expected in 2023.</p>\n\n<p>Pringle explained that <a href=\"https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2446122/gatewayone-and-attritableone-test-moves-joint-force-one-step-closer-to-iotmil-d/\">while the Dec. 9 test wasn’t fully successful</a>, it was incredibly useful from a research perspective. “We weren’t able to establish it in flight with the onboard communication gateway, but we still achieved achieved the objective, because we had a backup on the ground. And so the connections were made; we still got the job done.”</p>\n<p>Lt. Col. Kate Stowe, gatewayONE program manager at the Air Force Lifecycle Management Center (AFLMC), <a href=\"https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2446122/gatewayone-and-attritableone-test-moves-joint-force-one-step-closer-to-iotmil-d/\">said in a December press release</a> that the test had 18 test objectives and successfully achieved nine.</p>\n<p>The test involved flying <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/gatewayone/\">gatewayONE</a> on the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/xq-58a-valkyrie/\">XQ-58A Valkyrie</a> (now dubbed “attribableONE” by the Air Force and made by Kratos) to ‘translate’ between the incompatible machine codes of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the F-22 Raptor.(‘Attritable’ is a made-up Air Force term for low-cost — but not quite throw-away’ — drones that the service can afford to lose in combat.)</p>\n<p>GatewayONE — essentially a radio and antenna system put together by Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Honeywell — has been specifically developed under the service’s pivotal <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/advanced-battle-management-system/\">Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS)</a> to provide that translation. But it was unable to properly connect during the December test at Yuma Proving Grounds in Arizona, thus a ground-based backup, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/01/abms-demos-speed-new-capabilities-to-warfighters/\">proven in an earlier ABMS On-Ramp demo</a>, was used instead.</p>\n\n \n<p>Pringle explained that the Skyborg program, one of three <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/vanguard/\">AFRL Vanguard</a> programs for rushing new capability to the field, has three parts: the low-cost drone; the “autonomous core system” serving as the drone’s ‘brain;’ and the on-going experiment campaign. Next steps will be more tests this year, she added, involving “multiple prototypes.”</p>\n<p>AFLMC, the contracting agent for Skyborg, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/12/skyborg-prototype-demos-set-for-july-2021/\">announced 24-month contracts for three competitors:</a> Boeing, for $25.7 million; General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc., for $14.3 million; and Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems Inc., for $37.8 million. AFRL said the next round of flight tests would take place this July.</p>\n<p>Pringle noted that a key objective for the Skyborg program is keeping an “open architecture, and as much government data rights as we can get.” Another aim is to “allow the flexibility to adapt what Skyborg will be for the warfighters, and I think that will be an important part of the operational experimentation campaign.”</p>\n<p>She explained that the goal is to test out how the three prototypes might undertake different missions, such as “comms relays, weapons delivery or any number of things they would want to use that trainable system.”</p>\n<p>Golden Horde</p>\n<p>In her wide-ranging discussion, Pringle also addressed the status of another of AFRL’s ongoing Vanguards, the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/golden-horde/\">Golden Horde</a> project designed to develop new ‘swarming’ munitions equipped with data links to communicate, chose targets (based on pre-programmed algorithms) and coordinate strikes against an array of targets, independently from the human pilot. That project, too, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/01/afrls-golden-horde-swarms-would-increase-fighter-lethality/\">didn’t meet all of its objectives in its latest test, held Dec. 15.</a></p>\n<p>“It was another great learning opportunity,” Pringle said. “On the positive side, nine of 13 test objectives were met — things like the network radios were working, as well as the inter-swarm communications … But, not everything went according to plan.”</p>\n<p>AFRL and its partner in the program, the Weapons PEO led by  Brig. Gen. Heath Collins, are “still doing the analysis,” Pringle said. “We’re looking forward to two more flights this month, in fact, with four <a href=\"https://afresearchlab.com/technology/vanguards/successstories/golden-horde\">Collaborative Small Diameter Bomb</a> weapons and and looking at time on targets to try and up the game a little bit.”</p>\n<p>She added that she and Collins “have been reassessing what the overall long term scope is of this program, and what the end deliverable will be. A major component of that is building a digital architecture that will allow more testing of various kinds of collaborative technologies, and building in some containerized [software] solutions that could be more plug-and-play across weapons. I think ultimately that will allow a lot more flexibility, but I don’t really want to let too much out of the bag until Gen. Collins and I have another meeting in about a week.

{"title": "GM Defense: New President, New Factory, New Electric Truck", "publish_time": "2021-05-04 20:43:07", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: Tuesday was a big day for\nGM Defense\n, the\ntiny defense subsidiary\nof auto giant General Motors. The company:\nannounced a new president, former Army helicopter test pilot\nSteve DuMont\n, who spent 13 years at high-tech powerhouse Raytheon;\nofficially opened its new factory in Concord, N.C., where it’ll build\nhundreds\nof\nair-droppable Infantry Squad Vehicles\nfor the US Army;\nand unveiled an electric variant of the ISV, using the battery from the\nChevy Bolt\n– leveraging its parent company’s\n$27 billion, five-year investment plan\nin electric vehicles.\n“That vehicle is out driving around right now,” DuMont told me in an interview. “[We built it] in a pretty short period of time, on our own investment…We’ll bring it to Fort Benning next week and let some of the warfighters evaluate it.”\nThe electrified ISV is a company-funded concept car, not a formal prototype, but it’s tangible proof of GM Defense’s capability to build the Army’s proposed\nElectric Light Reconnaissance Vehicle\n. The Army has been leery of\nthe logistical complications of adding all-electric vehicles\nto its current diesel fleet; after all, there are no charging stations on the battlefield. But electric drive’s ability to move near-silently while powering extensive electronics is particularly attractive for scout units. And since the Electric Light Reconnaissance Vehicle would serve in light infantry brigades alongside Infantry Squad Vehicles, an ISV-derived ELRV would simplify logistics and training, putting GM Defense in a strong position.\nThat’s an impressive feat for a tiny operation. The new Concord factory, for instance, will have just 20 employees when fully staffed, building 14 vehicles a month – a minuscule sliver of GM’s global operation.

The Army has been leery of <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/04/do-soldiers-dream-of-electric-trucks/\">the logistical complications of adding all-electric vehicles</a> to its current diesel fleet; after all, there are no charging stations on the battlefield. But electric drive’s ability to move near-silently while powering extensive electronics is particularly attractive for scout units.

Philippe Lavigne, the Chief of French Air and Space Force (FASF).\nThe event’s capstone was not the first time the two jets have coordinated training. But the sheer scale and scope of the effort\n—\nwhich included 170 French pilots, flying crews, maintainers and support and logistics specialists, operating three Rafale fighters, two A400M transport aircrafts and one A330 Multi Role Transport Tanker (MRTT)\n—\nrepresented something special, Lavigne said.\n“There has been tremendous progress between the two Air Forces in the past years as not only do we train together in increasingly complex scenarios, but we are fighting together whether in the Middle East, the Sahel or in operations such as\nHamilton\nin Syria in 2018,” he told Breaking Defense while traveling back from the Pacific.\nBeing able to conduct a joint air operation such as the 2018 Syria campaign is not something one should take for granted in the modern threat environment, Lavigne stressed.\n‘’There can only be cooperation if there is a true will to cooperate,” he said. “This determination between our two Air Forces have been constantly growing and translates itself today into more and more information sharing, the insertion of active threats in ever more complex exercises and live monitoring and debrief. Today US and French Aviators share the same planning room and the end result can be seen in the skies.”\nChallenges of course remain, including one area where Lavigne sees clear need for improvement: ‘’We will not be able to win in the air, nor on the ground or in the seas for that matter, if we do not integrate multidomain capabilities, such as space and cyber.”\nSuch integration was one of the key focus of this two-part French mission, known as “Heifara-Wakea,” which started in France’s Mont-de-Marsan on June 20th. Over the course of the exercise, French pilots flew two sorties a day and held a readiness rate close to 100%.\nThe effort started with a long-range training raid from the French main land to Tahiti, which lasted 39 hours (i.e. 9 hours less than initially planned) with only one stop in Travis, California. The raid therefore included a 12 hour trip, which was the longest non-stop Rafale flight ever performed by the French military. It was also the first time such a large number of air assets visited French Polynesia, and the first time that the newest and the most upgraded air assets made the trip: the Rafales came with the Meteor long range missile and the newest AESA radar, the MRTT equipped with the latest L16-JRE (Joint Extension Range) data link and the A400M with a new Maritime Search and Rescue capability.\nLavigne called the effort a “laboratory of Premieres’’ before noting that the training event is a precursor for a 2023 mission that plans to project 20 Rafales and 10 MRTTs 20,000 KM from France, within a 48 hour window.\nOne of the interesting ‘’firsts’’ that has proven out during the exercise was the testing of the brand new French Air Operation Center, which was recently inaugurated in Lyon. Called CAPCO (for ‘’Centre Air de planification et de conduite des opérations’’), the new center was able to order and coordinate an in-depth Scalp strike right upon the arrival of the squadron in Tahiti in a simulated heavily defended anti-access, area denial scenario.\nUsing the MRTT as a forward C2 asset and a CAPCO relay nod is part of the revolution and the path towards the Future Combat Air System and the new collaborative air warfare doctrine, which is currently being written. As Lavigne noted, CAPCO must be understood in the dual context of the French Air and Space Force command of the NATO Reaction Force in 2022 and of the arrival of the new ACCS (Air Command and Control System) in NATO.\nHeifara-Wakea’s purpose, Lavigne said, was three fold. First, to protect “French citizens in our overseas departments and collectivities as well as our interests in the Indo-pacific region in general.” Second, to demonstrate the type of operational credibility needed in high end conflicts. And third, to cooperate with allies in the Pacific and to defend “in particular our freedom of navigation and our right to fly in this increasingly competitive part of the world.”\nThe cooperation with allies was on full display at the closing event of the exercise, on July 9, when top French and American air officers were joined by Philippe Etienne, the French ambassador to the United States, for the commemoration of the 240th anniversary of the 1781 Revolutionary War victory at Yorktown.\nThe same day, in Washington D.C., a new roadmap to reinforce an already strong cooperation between US and French special forces was signed by the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his French counterpart, Florence Parly.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>PARIS: A just-completed French training effort involving a number of high-end capabilities has helped prove out new technologies and concepts that will be vital to operations in the Pacific and elsewhere, France’s top Air Force officer tells Breaking Defense.</p>\n<p>The Heifara-Wakea event, which wrapped up July 7 with coordinated training between French Rafales and American F-22s operating out of US Pacific Air Force Command’s Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii, was a rousing success, according to Gen.

{"title": "BAE Offers Truck-Mounted Howitzer For Army Stryker Units", "publish_time": "2020-10-19 21:17:52", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: The Army is seeking a self-propelled replacement for its venerable towed artillery pieces. The old ones can’t keep up with mechanized\nStryker\nunits and lack armor protection. BAE Systems says its\nArcher armored howitzer\nis the quickest cannon on the draw — a life-or-death factor in fast-moving future combats.\nThe US is\nexperimenting intensely\nin how to speed the process from detecting a potential target to sending accurate target coordinates to a specific gun.

{"title": "MPF: Light Tank Competitors BAE & GD Head For Soldier Tests", "publish_time": "2020-10-19 18:14:00", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: After 24 years without a light tank in Army service, soldiers will climb aboard brand-new\nMobile Protected Firepower prototypes\nthis January.\n“It’s not just PowerPoint” anymore,\nMaj. Gen. Bryan Cummings\n, the Army’s Program Executive Officer for Ground Combat Systems (PEO-GCS), told me in an interview. “On Jan. 4th, we will have ... vehicles arriving at Fort Bragg.”\nArmy experts have already started safety testing on prototype MPF vehicles, officials told me. Actual combat soldiers will start training on two platoons of prototypes in January – four MPFs from BAE, four from rival General Dynamics – with field tests scheduled to begin in April. A formal Limited User Test will start in August or September, with the Army choosing the winning design in 2022 and the first operational unit of MPF entering active service in 2025.\nA General Dynamics spokesperson told me they’ve already delivered five MPF prototypes to the Army, with two more in final checkouts and another five being built for delivery by the end of the year. BAE Systems is also building 12 prototypes, but they declined to say whether they’d delivered vehicles yet or not.\nWhile the Army can’t comment on either contractor while the competition is ongoing,\nCummings said\n, “both are on track to meet the major milestones” – despite the disruptions of COVID-19.\nAfter three months of training, the troops will start what’s being called the Soldier Vehicle Assessment (SVA): four to five months of intensive field testing, including force-on-force wargames. It’s all part of the Army’s new emphasis on\ngetting real soldiers’ feedback on new weapons\nearly and often.\n“The soldiers actually get to drive the vehicles around, shoot them, train with them,” BAE business developer James Miller told me. “Their feedback [is] likely to be the most critical factor ... in the decision the Army’s going to make about who wins this contract.”\nThe soldier assessment isn’t just testing out the vehicles, however, Cummings told me: It’s also a test of the Army. Specifically, how can light infantry brigades, which today have few vehicles or mechanics, sustain and operate a 20-plus-ton tank?\nThe crucial distinction: MPF is\nnot\ngoing to the Army’s heavy brigades, which have lots of support troops and specialized equipment to take care of tracked armored vehicles. Instead, 14 MPFs per brigade will go to\nairborne\nand other light infantry units, which haven’t had tracked armor since the M551 Sheridan was retired and its replacement cancelled in 1990s.\nNow, MPF won’t be as fuel-hungry or maintenance-intensive as the massive M1 Abrams, America’s mainstay main battle tank. Even with add-on armor kits for high-threat deployments, it’ll be less than half as heavy as the M1. That’s because MPF isn’t meant to take on enemy tanks, at least not modern ones. Instead, it’s designed to be light enough to deploy rapidly by air, simple enough to sustain at the end of a long and tenuous supply line, but potent enough to take on enemy light armored vehicles, bunkers, dug-in machineguns, and the like.\nThat’s a tricky balance to strike\n. In fact, the Army has never found a light tank it really liked despite decades of trying. Only six\nM22 Locusts\nactually fought in World War II, the\nM41 Walker Bulldog\nwas too heavy for airborne units, the\nM551 Sheridan\nwas plagued by technical problems throughout its service from Vietnam to Panama, the M8 Armored Gun System and the Future Combat System were both cancelled.\nSo how do BAE and General Dynamics plan to square this circle?\nGeneral Dynamics emphasized lethality in their interview with me. Their Lima tank plant builds the M1 Abrams, and while the MPF is smaller – though the company didn’t divulge details, GD’s version reportedly has a 105mm cannon, compared to the Abrams’ 120mm – it will have the same fire controls and electronics as the latest model of its big brother.\n“If you sat in a Mobile Protected Firepower turret, you would think you were sitting in a [M1]\nSEPV3\nturret,” a GD spokesperson told me. “It’s all the same displays, architectures, power distribution, etc.”\nGD’s design evolved from their Griffin demonstrators,\nprominently\ndisplayed\nfor several years at AUSA annual meetings. It’s got automotive components\nderived from the ASCOD/Ajax family widely used in Europe\nand an 800 horsepower engine. GD didn’t tell me how much their vehicle weighed, but, depending on the armor package installed, the demonstrators ranged from\n28 tons\nto\n50 tons\n. Those figures would give horsepower/weight ratios ranging from 28 hp/ton, better than any model of the\nAbrams\n, to 16, which would make MPF much more sluggish.\nBAE, by contrast, emphasized their design’s compactness and ease of maintenance – considerations as critical as firepower for a light infantry unit. BAE actually built the\nM8 AGS\ncancelled in the ’90s drawdown, and while they’ve thoroughly overhauled that design for MPS with a new engine, new electronics, and underbody blast-proofing against roadside bombs, they’ve tried to preserve its airborne-friendly qualities.\n“The old M8 fit inside a\nC-130\n; in fact, it was air droppable,” Miller told me. “There’s no requirement for that in the current MPF program, but we decided to stick with that as a design constraint: [Our MPF can] fit inside a C-130; we can do three on a\nC-17\n.”\nBAE’s engine is less potent than GD’s, with only 550 horsepower. With the base configuration coming in at under 30 tons, that equates to over 18 hp/ton, with heavier armor packages reducing performance from there.\nBut the big selling point of the engine is ease of access, Miller argued. Engine maintenance on a tank requires a crane and partially disassembling the armor, but a mechanic can slide the BAE MPF’s engine in and out of the chassis with a hand crank. If the MPF breaks down or gets stuck, it can be towed away by a truck, without requiring a special heavy recovery vehicle as an M1 does.\n“The infantry brigades are light. They don’t have long logistics tails. They don’t have a ton of mechanics and recovery vehicles,” Miller emphasized. “The vehicle has to be as mobile as them and fit inside their organization.”\nThe Army estimates the life-cycle cost of MPF, from development to procurement to maintenance and retirement, at\n$16 billion\n. Whichever vehicle wins the Army contract will have an edge in\nsales worldwide – including, potentially, to the Marine Corps\n, which is retiring its M1s as\ntoo heavy for modern amphibious warfare\n.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: After 24 years without a light tank in Army service, soldiers will climb aboard brand-new <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2018/12/army-picks-bae-gd-for-mpf-light-tank-prototypes/\">Mobile Protected Firepower prototypes</a> this January.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just PowerPoint” anymore, <a href=\"https://www.peogcs.army.mil/documents/BIO-PEO.pdf\">Maj.

BAE actually built the <a href=\"https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m8-ags.htm\">M8 AGS</a> cancelled in the ’90s drawdown, and while they’ve thoroughly overhauled that design for MPS with a new engine, new electronics, and underbody blast-proofing against roadside bombs, they’ve tried to preserve its airborne-friendly qualities.</p>\n<p>“The old M8 fit inside a <a href=\"https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/1555054/c-130-hercules/\">C-130</a>; in fact, it was air droppable,” Miller told me. “There’s no requirement for that in the current MPF program, but we decided to stick with that as a design constraint: [Our MPF can] fit inside a C-130; we can do three on a <a href=\"https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/1529726/c-17-globemaster-iii/\">C-17</a>.”</p>\n<p>BAE’s engine is less potent than GD’s, with only 550 horsepower. With the base configuration coming in at under 30 tons, that equates to over 18 hp/ton, with heavier armor packages reducing performance from there.</p>\n<p>But the big selling point of the engine is ease of access, Miller argued. Engine maintenance on a tank requires a crane and partially disassembling the armor, but a mechanic can slide the BAE MPF’s engine in and out of the chassis with a hand crank. If the MPF breaks down or gets stuck, it can be towed away by a truck, without requiring a special heavy recovery vehicle as an M1 does.</p>\n<p>“The infantry brigades are light. They don’t have long logistics tails. They don’t have a ton of mechanics and recovery vehicles,” Miller emphasized. “The vehicle has to be as mobile as them and fit inside their organization.”</p>\n<p>The Army estimates the life-cycle cost of MPF, from development to procurement to maintenance and retirement, at <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/08/gao-questions-armys-62b-cost-estimates-for-combat-vehicles/\">$16 billion</a>. Whichever vehicle wins the Army contract will have an edge in <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2018/12/mpf-light-tank-profits-estimated-495m-byron-callan/\">sales worldwide – including, potentially, to the Marine Corps</a>, which is retiring its M1s as <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/04/marine-commandant-less-a-second-land-army-more-light-amphib-ships/\">too heavy for modern amphibious warfare</a>.</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["82nd Airborne", "acquisition", "armored vehicles", "army", "BAE", "Gen.

These follow the release of\nNIST’s definition of critical software\n. The definition and these accompanying recommendations were required by the administration’s\ncyber executive order\nissued in May.\nThe definition and security recommendations are part of what some administration officials\nhave called\nan effort to “jumpstart the market for secure software.” They come after a series of significant hacks over the past year that have affected federal agencies and the defense industrial base. The purpose of these publications is to recommend actions federal agencies should take to shore up software security.\nThe Security Measures publication focuses on running software, while the Recommended Minimum Standards focuses on developing it.\nThe Security Measures publication largely entails a set of principles for zero-trust security.

Preventing breaches is still a ‘must,’ but it is also important to have robust incident detection, response, and recovery capabilities.”\nTo that end, the publication sets out five objectives, along with a set of actionable security practices and tools federal agencies should implement to meet each objective.

{"title": "EXCLUSIVE: Space Is At Heart Of JADC2, Says Maj. Gen. Crider", "publish_time": "2020-12-23 09:01:49", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: The US military’s ambitious effort to create a command and control network to run future\nAll Domain Operations\nis “predicated on effective space-based capabilities,” says Maj. Gen. Kim Crider, Space Force acting chief technology innovation officr.\n“\nJoint All-Domain Command and Control,\nreally, is grounded in space. Space is a joint all-domain fight,” she told me in an interview. “Space depends on information from other domains so that we can assure our space assets and we can understand where there might be threats that could impact space coming from other domains, to include the cyberspace domain. … So, space is fully a partner in the\nJoint All-Domain Operations\nand significant contributor to Joint All-Domain C2.”\nCrider, whose position within Space Force is new and unique among the services, actually is an old hand with regard to creation of Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2), and the Air Force’s\nAdvanced Battle Management System (ABMS)\nprogram that is developing technologies to underpin JADC2. She is the brains behind the creation of the\nUnified Data Library (UDL),\nin her former position as the Air Force’s first chief data officer.\nAs\nBreaking D\nreaders will recall,\nthe UDL was first developed in 2019\nto bring together in one accessible, cloud-based environment data from all the military’s space sensors and allow access to that data based on all users — to include allies — based on security status. Since that time, the UDL has been expanded include data sensors in other domains,\nincluding cyber,\nand now has evolved into a component of ABMS.\n“The Unified Data Library is a phenomenal capability,” she said. “We have it running in a production cloud environment — we have users that are pulling data from the Unified Data Library into their various applications, to be able to understand what’s happening in the space domain or other domains. So, the Unified Data Library is able to pull data through from other sensors and other domains, and we’ve integrated the Unified Data Library as a core component of the\ndataONE\ncapabilities of ABMS.”\nCrider said that the Space Force plans to continue to evolve and enhance the UDL. “It’s a kind of capability that will never be ‘quote, unquote’ done,” she said. “We’ll always be adding new sensors and new services and new features … because JADC2 is never done. We need to ensure that we can always stay ahead of the threat; we stay ahead of our adversaries.”\nCrider’s job isn’t just to shepherd the Space Force’s role in JADC2, however. In his\nChief of Space Operations Planning Guidance\n, Gen. Jay Raymond put a high priority on\nrisk taking and innovation\nas the new force organizes, trains and equips its forces — on Friday, finally and awkwardly named Guardians (I AM GROOT!) — for space operations. Crider is charged with seeing that Raymond’s order is implemented as Space Force pursues new science and technology (S&T) initiatives.\nThat includes pushing the acquisition community and working with\nSpace and Missile Systems Center (SMC)\nto focus resources on integrating cutting-edge tech into development programs. “As a headquarters function, we kind of lead strategy and policy advocacy for the future capabilities in the technology and innovation space,” she said.\n“I am looking at the S&T portfolio, and the roadmap for what kind of S&T capabilities we need within the Space Force, partnering very closely with\nAir Force Research Lab\nas our primary provider of S&T,” she elaborated. “But of course we work very closely with, not only Air Force Research Lab, but the larger DoD lab community, and partners at NRO and NASA as well on various S&T initiatives.” She added that her shop also collaborates with commercial industry to take advantage of their efforts “to advance the future of space capabilities. So that’s a really important part of the portfolio.”\n“Digital transformation” is perhaps the part of Crider’s portfolio that is receiving a lot of attention, she said, both within the Department of Defense but also from Congress and outside experts. “It’s a very very exciting area,” Crider said. “I would say that I spent a significant portion of my time in really looking at how do we infuse digital technologies, digital capability, digital processes, digital skill sets, and the application of digital skills across the service — across all of our commands down to the individual space professional level, and on up.”\nThe CSO Planning Guidance lists “Create a Digital Service to Accelerate Innovation” as one of Raymond’s five key priorities. Raymond himself is fond of saying Space Force “was born digital.” Given that Space Force in reality has been handed responsibility from the former Air Force Space Command for legacy space systems — from satellite communications networks to the\nSpace-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) missile warning satellites\n— I asked Crider to explain what exactly that catch phrase means.\n“So, Space Force being the first digital service, or being ‘born digital,’ it’s a a really important statement to make.” she responded. “I think it speaks to the fact that, as a new service, we have an opportunity here to really establish ourselves in a new way — leveraging digital technologies, and leveraging digital processes and practices in a new way to really enhance our mission set and enhance our ability to achieve our priorities.”\nCrider said Space Force needs to move to digital processes because it needs “to be very agile, very adaptive and very flexible” due to its small size — both to be able to stay on top of an “ever-changing threat environment” that will demand rapid decision-making, and to be able to advocate its needs within the Pentagon’s large bureaucracy.\n“We need to be able to access data, analysis and information at the speed of need,” she elaborated. “And the only way to do that, especially given that we’re very flat and very small, is to leverage digital technologies and to be a digital service. So, the idea is, ‘hey, we’re starting out as a new service, let’s start out with a ‘born digital’ mindset, with the idea that we are going to infuse ‘digital’ into everything that we do’.”\nThat need to be able to gather data, analyze it and generate actionable information thus means that “infrastructure and data analytics” compose another major “thrust area” for the technology and innovation office.\nCrider said her team is working closely with Air Force Chief Information Officer Lauren Knausenberger, and Air Force Chief Data Officer Eileen Vidrine to ensure “that we’ve got the right IT infrastructure in place” both for today and the future. This includes “defending and protecting our information.”\nRegarding data analytics, Space Force is working to apply\nmachine learning\ntechniques “to really ensure that we get the most out of that data to enhance our decision making processes, both from a business standpoint through our digital headquarters initiatives, as well as operational analysis and the capabilities we need to enhance our operational decisions.”\nCrider said she sees Space Force in many was as leading the way for DoD in its overarching digital transformation effort and in implementing the new\n“DoD Data Strategy”\nreleased by\nthen-Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist in October.\n“I think that we are leading in many ways,” she said. “That’s certainly part of the idea of ‘born digital.’ We have that opportunity to try some new things. Our chief has really encouraged that — that we try and that we really lean forward, and we allow ourselves the opportunity to really look at new and better ways to do things and not be burdened by the ways of the past.”\nFurther, she said, because of its small size, Space Force has “the ability to more easily experiment, if you will, with the new capabilities, and to pilot some new ideas that we can scale a little bit more quickly because we’re scaling it over a relatively small sized organization. … And I know the other services are looking to us to try some of these things, see how they play out, to see if they may be able to adopt some of these new ideas.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The US military’s ambitious effort to create a command and control network to run future <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/all-domain-operations/\">All Domain Operations</a> is “predicated on effective space-based capabilities,” says Maj.

Crider is charged with seeing that Raymond’s order is implemented as Space Force pursues new science and technology (S&T) initiatives.</p>\n\n \n<p>That includes pushing the acquisition community and working with <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/space-and-missile-systems-center/\">Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC)</a> to focus resources on integrating cutting-edge tech into development programs. “As a headquarters function, we kind of lead strategy and policy advocacy for the future capabilities in the technology and innovation space,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I am looking at the S&T portfolio, and the roadmap for what kind of S&T capabilities we need within the Space Force, partnering very closely with <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/air-force-research-laboratory-afrl/\">Air Force Research Lab</a> as our primary provider of S&T,” she elaborated. “But of course we work very closely with, not only Air Force Research Lab, but the larger DoD lab community, and partners at NRO and NASA as well on various S&T initiatives.” She added that her shop also collaborates with commercial industry to take advantage of their efforts “to advance the future of space capabilities. So that’s a really important part of the portfolio.”</p>\n<p>“Digital transformation” is perhaps the part of Crider’s portfolio that is receiving a lot of attention, she said, both within the Department of Defense but also from Congress and outside experts. “It’s a very very exciting area,” Crider said. “I would say that I spent a significant portion of my time in really looking at how do we infuse digital technologies, digital capability, digital processes, digital skill sets, and the application of digital skills across the service — across all of our commands down to the individual space professional level, and on up.”</p>\n<p>The CSO Planning Guidance lists “Create a Digital Service to Accelerate Innovation” as one of Raymond’s five key priorities. Raymond himself is fond of saying Space Force “was born digital.” Given that Space Force in reality has been handed responsibility from the former Air Force Space Command for legacy space systems — from satellite communications networks to the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/sbirs/\">Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) missile warning satellites</a> — I asked Crider to explain what exactly that catch phrase means.</p>\n<p>“So, Space Force being the first digital service, or being ‘born digital,’ it’s a a really important statement to make.” she responded. “I think it speaks to the fact that, as a new service, we have an opportunity here to really establish ourselves in a new way — leveraging digital technologies, and leveraging digital processes and practices in a new way to really enhance our mission set and enhance our ability to achieve our priorities.”</p>\n<p>Crider said Space Force needs to move to digital processes because it needs “to be very agile, very adaptive and very flexible” due to its small size — both to be able to stay on top of an “ever-changing threat environment” that will demand rapid decision-making, and to be able to advocate its needs within the Pentagon’s large bureaucracy.</p>\n<p>“We need to be able to access data, analysis and information at the speed of need,” she elaborated. “And the only way to do that, especially given that we’re very flat and very small, is to leverage digital technologies and to be a digital service.  So, the idea is, ‘hey, we’re starting out as a new service, let’s start out with a ‘born digital’ mindset, with the idea that we are going to infuse ‘digital’ into everything that we do’.”</p>\n<p>That need to be able to gather data, analyze it and generate actionable information thus means that “infrastructure and data analytics” compose another major “thrust area” for the technology and innovation office.</p>\n<p>Crider said her team is working closely with Air Force Chief Information Officer Lauren Knausenberger, and Air Force Chief Data Officer Eileen Vidrine to ensure “that we’ve got the right IT infrastructure in place” both for today and the future. This includes “defending and protecting our information.”</p>\n<p>Regarding data analytics, Space Force is working to apply <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/machine-learning/\">machine learning</a> techniques “to really ensure that we get the most out of that data to enhance our decision making processes, both from a business standpoint through our digital headquarters initiatives, as well as operational analysis and the capabilities we need to enhance our operational decisions.”</p>\n<p>Crider said she sees Space Force in many was as leading the way for DoD in its overarching digital transformation effort and in implementing the new <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2020/Oct/08/2002514180/-1/-1/0/DOD-DATA-STRATEGY.PDF\">“DoD Data Strategy”</a> released by <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/10/new-pentagon-strategy-to-share-data-like-ammunition/\">then-Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist in October.</a></p>\n<p>“I think that we are leading in many ways,” she said. “That’s certainly part of the idea of ‘born digital.’  We have that opportunity to try some new things. Our chief has really encouraged that — that we try and that we really lean forward, and we allow ourselves the opportunity to really look at new and better ways to do things and not be burdened by the ways of the past.”</p>\n<p>Further, she said, because of its small size, Space Force has “the ability to more easily experiment, if you will, with the new capabilities, and to pilot some new ideas that we can scale a little bit more quickly because we’re scaling it over a relatively small sized organization. … And I know the other services are looking to us to try some of these things, see how they play out, to see if they may be able to adopt some of these new ideas.”</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["Air Force Research Laboratory AFRL", "CSO Planning Guidance", "digital design", "digital engineering", "DoD Data Strategy", "Gen.

{"title": "DARPA AI Builds New Networks On The Fly", "publish_time": "2020-10-28 13:00:46", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: How do you write software to get two previously incompatible military systems to share data? DARPA’s suggestion: have an artificial intelligence write it for you — in just 45 minutes.\n“The tool is auto-writing software instead of a human,” DARPA\nStrategic Technology director Tim Grayson said\n. In early trials where real military operators came up with specific “force packages” of combat systems and challenged DARPA to integrate them, he told me, “they’re creating entirely new systems of systems architectures, getting the software... in about 45 minutes.”\n(Grayson spoke to\nBreaking Defense\nahead of his keynote remarks Wednesday at\nNDIA’s JADC2 conference)\n.\nThat particular program – called STITCHES, a\nnested acronym\ntoo awful to unpack here – was used in the Air Force’s August\nABMS “On Ramp” experiment\n. It is just one of roughly 20 DARPA projects attacking various aspects of\nMosaic Warfare\n, a DARPA concept for future conflict that goes beyond the Pentagon’s new emphasis\non joint All-Domain Operations\n.\nThe armed services\nnow all pay at least lip service\nto the idea of\nnetworking all their assets and coordinating operations\nacross the DoD-endorsed domains of land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. But DARPA argues that traditional hierarchies and tables of organization just aren’t flexible enough for this new kind of fighting. Instead, the defense research agency wants future commanders to grab assets as needed, then create an electronic network and a task force structure optimized to the specific mission, on the spot.\n“At their core,” Grayson told me, “they are on-the-fly systems of systems that involve machine to machine connectivity.”\nIf traditional military organization is a jigsaw puzzle, where each piece has its pre-planned place and can fit nowhere else, DARPA’s preferred model is a mosaic, where the artist can fit tiles of any color together wherever needed to form the desired pattern.\nThat’s not how troops are trained, organized, or networked today – but the creative potential is there. “If you look at how an Air Force squadron does its mission planning for the next day’s sorties, or how a Marine Corps unit does combined arms maneuver warfare, it is very fluid and adaptive,” Grayson said, “but our warfighters are limited by the organizations and the equipment that are apportioned to them before — well before — a fight begins.” What if they could custom-tailor their organization and equipment to the fight at hand?\nSo Grayson and his team are coming up with organizational concepts and technological tools to make Mosaic Warfare possible. The idea is to have AI automate the gruntwork of connecting different systems so humans can focus on\nwhat\nneeds to work together to succeed in the mission, instead of\nhow\n.\nTraditionally, when two military systems can share data – a radar sending target coordinates to a missile launcher, for example – it’s because they were designed to do it and have a unique, customized connection, which isn’t compatible with anything else. But for All-Domain Operations the military wants every system to be able to share data with every other. In the future, you can require every new thing you build to be compatible; but for the vast inventories of legacy systems, you’re stuck kludging together connections one at time. The problem is, that job gets\nexponentially harder\nwith each thing you add to the network. Connecting 10 items in every possible combination requires 45 connections, connecting 20 requires 190, connecting 100 requires 4,590....\n“If I’m sitting in a program office, trying to create so-called interoperability for all future contingencies in every possible permutation of this system of systems, the combinatorics of that the problem are immense,” Grayson told me. “That’s why a lot of these integration programs get to be very expensive and take so long, when you have to hand-code each of those n-square translations and test them.”\n“How do we create that Internet-like experience where the underlying fabric is a bunch of clunky old tactical radios?” he asked. Well, that’s where STITCHES and similar technology comes in. The idea is to replace laborious manual coding with automation, so you can connect whatever you need to quickly. That lets you move from a fixed and limited list of things you can connect with to an Internet-like breath of options, where you type in what you want and see the data immediately.\nOther DARPA mosaic warfare efforts apply AI to related tasks that, today, require laborious staff work and rigid planning. “That’s why we have so many people that sit in an Air Operations Center,” Grayson said. “Yes, I need the commander and the strategist sitting there deciding the big picture. Where do I want to go move things and what targets do I want to go after? And then I’ve got all the down-in-the-weeds planners, who are [asking]: ‘oh! can I actually reroute those aircraft? And do they have enough fuel? And do they have a tanker that can rendezvous? And have I done airspace deconfliction?’”\nThe first class of question – given my assets, obstacles, and circumstances, how do I achieve my objectives? – is what’s called an “open-world problem,” Grayson told me, and it’s something AI struggles with. For the foreseeable future, that kind of creative problem-solving is a job for humans. But the second class of question – how do I get this physical thing to this place by this time? – is a “closed-world problem” whose clear constraints make it solvable for AI.\nIt’s like how Uber’s software matches you almost instantly with a driver. You, the human customer and not an AI, made the decision on where to go out of all possible destinations in the world. Each individual driver, not an AI, makes the decision to drive you or not, based on your\ndestination and fare\n. What the AI does is simply figure out which drivers are nearby and available to ask, then keeps on asking until one is take you. The humans bound the problem, the AI solves it within those constraints.\nOne example is airspace deconfliction, the military extreme-sport version of air traffic control. How do you have Air Force, Navy, Marine, and Army assets from stealth jets to helicopters, from cruise missiles to artillery shells, flying over the same area of the map, dynamically evading enemy threats and striking targets, without running afoul of one another? Traditionally, you allocate invisible lanes in the sky for different organizations and types of aircraft or weapon, so you never (for example) fly manned planes into a path that howitzer shells might take. But because human staff officers can’t manually renegotiate and reallocate airspace allocations all that fast, you end up constraining your flight paths more narrowly than you need to at any given moment.\nAt any given time, “there’s as much as 95% excess volume of airspace that isn’t used,” Grayson said. “That’s essentially an opportunity cost. [Maybe] I really wish I could fire that long-range missile that’s going to go right though someone else’s lane. If I could validate in real time... that missile corridor is going to be free of any aircraft it might collide with, then that’s an opportunity I’ve created for myself.” So this year DARPA created a program called\nASTARTE\nto automatically check and deconflict flight paths.\nDARPA’s airspace deconfliction concept, ASTARTE (Air Space Total Awareness for Rapid Tactical Execution)There’s very little of SkyNet here. The humans remain very much in charge. Yes,\nDARPA AI programs like AlphaDogfight\nare often described as\nreplacing humans – in this case fighter pilots – with superior machines\n. But that’s a superficial understanding, Grayson argues. AI is replacing humans only in certain tasks, Grayson say, which frees humans up for higher purposes.\n“The big, catchy, attention-getting, flashy part of it, is we’re flying AI to dogfight… and so, yeah, that’s cool,” Grayson told me. But if the jets can fly themselves in combat, then what could the highly trained human pilots be doing instead?\n“if you don’t have to be worried about the detailed hand-eye coordination of flying the jet, you can focus more on doing the battle management,” Grayson argued. “The pilots sitting there flying in these aircraft that are autonomously conducting dogfights – besides hopefully not clenching the sides of the seat with white knuckles – are going to be given high-level cognitive management tasks. [You] automate away the button pushing\nso the human operator can function on a more cognitive level.\n”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: How do you write software to get two previously incompatible military systems to share data?

Use these cheaper aircraft and you don’t have buy as many F-35A fighters,\nB-21 bombers\nand other stealth aircraft. Nothing is further from the truth. The Air Force needs a mix of next-generation drones, including attritable systems, and a large force of 5\nth\ngeneration aircraft that can team to achieve decisive effects in future battlespaces.\nThe Air Force recently announced it was awarding contracts to develop\nartificial intelligence (AI)\nsoftware and associated technologies for a new type of aircraft it calls low-cost attritable UAVs. These AI-enabled aircraft will be capable of teaming with other manned and unmanned aircraft to counter enemy air forces, conduct electronic warfare, act as sensors and communications platforms, and strike targets with precision. The Air Force calls these UAVs “attritable” because they are designed to fly a limited number of sorties and have unit costs that range between $2 million to $20 million depending on their mission systems. This makes them affordable enough to use in high-threat environments where the risk of being shot down is too great for manned aircraft.\nWithout question, buying a significant number of low-cost attritable UAVs will help the service increase the size of its combat aircraft inventory, which is at an all-time low. Attritable UAVs such as the XQ-58 Valkyrie will have ranges of 3,000 nm and carry payloads of weapons or mission systems that weigh up to 1,200 pounds.\nAppropriately equipped, attritable UAVs will be able to find, fix, track, and provide targeting information to penetrating and standoff strike aircraft; jam enemy radars; act as decoys; and perform other missions independently or teamed with manned aircraft to increase the Air Force’s survivability and lethality. Because they are being designed to launch from a containerized rail launch system and recover after a sortie by parachute without using a runway, attritable UAVs will also reduce the USAF’s reliance on using vulnerable airfields to generate combat sorties. This is a critical new capability, since Chinese or Russian missile attacks against under-defended theater airbases could severely degrade the service’s combat tempo.\nAttritable UAVs—their relatively low cost, long ranges, and sizes suitable for runway free operations—make them valuable complementary and additive capabilities, not replacements for 5\nth\ngeneration aircraft. In many ways, procuring attritable UAVs will help the Air Force create a high-low mix of capabilities that provides distinct value for operations across the conflict spectrum. F-35As, B-21s—and likely the USAF’s\nCombat aircraft like the F-35 and B-21 will also bring greater payload capacity to the fight compared to attritable UAVs. Given the size of China and Russia’s forces and military infrastructure, the number of targets USAF may be tasked to strike in a future peer conflict could exceed targets attacked during\nall\nU.S. air campaigns over the last 30 years combined. This increases the Air Force’s need for aircraft that can deliver larger numbers of weapons per sortie. For instance, the B-2 bomber has an unrefueled range of 6,000 nm and a payload capacity of 40,000 pounds, which translates to mission loadouts of up to 80 500-pound bombs and many more 250-pound Small Diameter Bombs (SDB). This is a key reason we are buying the next-generation B-21.\nBy contrast, an attritable UAV with 600- to 1,200-pound payload capacity could carry two to four SDB-sized weapons per sortie. Although there are no technical limitations to developing UAVs that carry more weapons, doing so would significantly grow their size since they would need a larger weapons bay as well as the capacity to carry more fuel to maintain their long ranges. This would increase their unit cost and it would also require them to take off from a runway, negating a major advantage of the attritable concept. Instead, runway-independent attritable UAVs should be used in ways that will significantly improve the survivability and effectiveness of bombers that can deliver far more weapons per sortie.\nNeither of these points argue against the Air Force buying hundreds of low-cost attritable UAVs as quickly as possible—far from it. The service should and must develop a family of UAVs that will enable it to do what it cannot do today, such as conduct large-scale manned-unmanned teaming operations and generate sorties independent of airfields. This sort of mass and flexibility will prove essential in a conflict with China or Russia.\nThe Air Force should not trade off some portion of\nits planned 5\nth\ngeneration aircraft\nto pay for alternate priorities. The future demands that the Air Force pursue a force that consists of the most cost-effective means to deliver mission results, taking maximum advantage of what drones and manned aircraft will bring to the fight.

{"title": "Roper Hints NGAD Could Replace F-35; Why? Life-Cycle Costs", "publish_time": "2021-01-14 21:14:45", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: The F-35 fighter jet’s exorbitant life-cycle costs means the Air Force cannot afford to buy as many aircraft as it needs to fight and win a war today, which makes the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program all the more important, says outgoing Air Force acquisition czar Will Roper.\n“I think the F-35 program is a long way from being at a sustainment point that we need. I think it’s a long way from being an affordable fighter that we can buy in bulk,” he told reporters today.\n“That’s the reason why Next-Generation Air Dominance is so important to the Air Force,” he said. “It doesn’t just represent a next-generation fighter with bells and whistles that we will need in warfighting. It doesn’t just represent a completely different acquisition paradigm. It also represents a chance to design an airplane that is more sustainable than the F-35 if, in fact, the F-35 cannot get its cost-per-flying-hour down.”\nRoper would not be drawn on whether the Air Force was considering downsizing it plan to build a total inventory of 1,763 F-35s — with the Air Force requesting 48 aircraft in 2021, and planning to ask for the same annual buy for the foreseeable future,\naccording to a study last month by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n“But what I can say is we’re not at the sustainment price point we need to be for a very large fleet. So, the next few years are critical for the F 35 program,” he added.\nHe seemed to suggest that, all things considered, perhaps the answer is to turn to NGAD to more rapidly build a wartime-fit fighter fleet.\n“I very much hope for the future of the program, but I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t prepare for the worst. And so you can see that the movements that we have made in the TacAir portfolio have set the Air Force up to have options, so that our eggs are not in one proverbial basket,” he said.\nRoper explained that Air Force fighters have to be ready to establish air dominance on day one of a war (along with satellites to secure establish communications.) “If they don’t win the day, then there will be no time for the rest of the services to join.” This is why the quantity of F-35s available matters, he said, as well as the quality of its capabilities.\n“As to the quality, I think everyone feels pleased as the F-35 goes through testing, but it’s very much focused on Block Four as the next step that has to be taken. Quantity goes directly to whether the cost-per-flying-hour can come down,” he said. “And right now the F-35 has a good ‘sticker price,’ but its cost of ownership is not where it needs to be, making the quantities that the Air Force may need to purchase in question.”\nPrime contractor Lockheed Martin’s ongoing Block 4 update includes both hardware and software to enable the aircraft with faster computers, more missiles, a panoramic cockpit display, longer ranges, as well as the capability to team with drones. But the Government Accountability Office\nfound a $1.5 billion increase\nin the F-35’s Block 4 upgrade costs for 2019 — now up to $12.1 billion. On top of that, the update has experienced numerous delays. Indeed, GAO begged to differ on the quality issue: “The F-35 aircraft in the field have not met standards for reliability and maintainability, indicating that the program is not delivering aircraft at the level of quality expected,” the report said.\n“Work on Block 4 upgrades continues and will bring more capability to the warfighter through an agile development process based on incremental software upgrades, providing continuous improvements and further widening the gap over legacy platforms,” a Lockheed Martin spokesperson said in an email.\nThat question about affordability, in turn, “is why,” Roper said, “other tactical aviation options are appealing to have in the mix, so that the Air Force has options number one; and number two, there’s competition, there’s pressure, on industry to improve, which would not be there if there was only one show in town.”\nLockheed Martin “understands the importance of F-35 affordability, both with regard to production and sustainment, and is focused on offering this unmatched capability at a cost similar to that of legacy aircraft,” the spokesperson said. “We are currently delivering F-35s at or below the cost of less capable fourth generation aircraft, while also lowering the sustainment costs by 40% over the past five years.”\nRoper said fixing the F-35’s myriad issues requires the Air Force, its software development teams, the Joint Program Office, and Lockheed Martin all “to run the same direction and at the same pace to make a difference.” He\nreiterated that the service’s top software hub\n, Kessel Run, is “fully dedicated to helping on the sustainment of the system.” Kessel Run is working a replacement for Lockheed Martin’s long-troubled\nAutonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS)\nused to track parts and schedule maintenance, called\nODIN (for Operational Integrated Data Network.)\n“I’ve made a lot of the Air Force available, above and beyond the normal call of duty, to the program,” he said.\nLong-time aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia said that, while “the 1,763 USAF F-35A number has always been one of the stranger fictions in defense procurement” because the Air Force simply can’t afford that many no matter what, it’s way too early to count on NGAD as a replacement.\n“Basically, they can afford about 50 a year, given competing priorities, and assuming 20-25 years at that rate, the likely total is around 1,000-1,200,” he said in an email. “There are big variables, particularly regarding the next combat aircraft to enter procurement. Flying NGAD prototypes may or may not tell us something about that. We’ll need to learn more about how long it will take to missionize and get ready for production and service. But the idea that F-35 procurement could ramp down to divert cash for a\nDigital Century Series\nsounds very flawed to me.”\nNGAD and Digital Engineering\nHow important is this? When I asked Roper what program he’d most like to see succeed in the next year, he chose NGAD and the Digital Century Series model he’s championed as an acquisition strategy.\n“Specifically, what I would like to see get over the goal line would be taking\ndigital engineering\nto its most fulsome representation in Next-Generation Air Dominance, because it matters for so much more than building a next-generation tactical airplane,” he said. All of our programs are watching NGAD to see how far they can push the digital envelope, and not just Air Force, [also] Space Force. I’ve got every PEO in Space Force, including our Chief of Space Operations Gen. [Jay] Raymond, briefed into all the digital work we’re doing, and now our space programs are following suit trying to replicate digital practices for satellites.\n“I view it as a tide that can raise all boats, or, for the Air Force, a wind that can raise all planes, or, for the Space Force, a rocket that can raise all orbital eccentricities — I don’t know what the right analogy is, but it’s that big of a deal,” he said.\n“Digital engineering is one of the biggest things that I’ve seen in eight years,” he stressed. “It’s the last thing I owe the Air Force; it’s the reason why I’m still here working around the clock with a newborn: to get out the last guidance on digital engineering before I’m not able to talk to the Air Force for a very long time. So, if I’m writing well, which is very difficult to do when you’re not getting sleep, I should be able to push that guidance out to them next week. And then hope that these first programs do a top-shelf job of implementing it.”\nABMS\nThe roll out of the first products from the service’s high-priority\nAdvanced Battle Management System (ABMS)\nprogram is another accomplishment Roper hopes to pull off\nbefore he steps down Jan. 19.\n“With the release one acquisition strategy being signed — I should do that as one of the last things I do in this position before the inauguration — that’ll be a normal program, with a normal baseline, and a normal test schedule, a normal everything,” he said. “It’s a fairly boring acquisition, but we had to do things differently to build the raw ingredients for that first release.”\n“ReleaseONE,” the initial ABMS package, will comprise “16 or 17” separate ‘products’ — such as\ncloudONE\nand\nplatformONE\n— that have been tested out through the ABMS program’s series of ‘on-ramp’ experiments — all in all making up the equivalent of “a miniature version of the Internet applied to military systems,” Roper said.\n“You’ve got cloud, which we all know our devices are connected to, and big analytics there; we’ll have transport layers through space and other means, which we all use in the Internet of Things. We’ll have the equivalent of cell towers that are actually routing data between different waveforms in different devices; and then the devices themselves are those that are doing the business in the Air Force, right up front against the adversary.”\nIn particular, he elaborated, the Air Mobility Fleet — specifically tanker aircraft — “will be playing the role of a flying cell tower translating between all the different waveforms and pushing data to tactical aircraft that are inside the denied comms or denied [positioning, navigation and timing] envelope.” They also will carry software capable of data processing, and creating “courses of action development at the edge.” (While Roper didn’t mention which tanker aircraft would be kitted out with the new ABMS capabilities, including\ngatewayONE,\ncolleague Valerie Insinna\nreported on Tuesday\nthat the front-runner is\nBoeing’s new KC-46.\n(The tanker was designed for signals intelligence sensors.)\nRoper noted that when he began the ABMS program, none of the foundational elements for creating a military Internet of Things even existed. “Two years ago we had none of the fundamental building blocks for an Internet in the military, we had to build them project by project,” he said. ‘I didn’t have any Internet-type stuff. That’s really important. I hope you’ll be able to convey that to readers.”\nHe said that he is hopeful the roll out of the first ABMS program of record will go some ways toward convincing a highly skeptical Congress that ABMS is the right thing at the right time and is being pursued in the right way. The acquisition strategy is “standard,” he said, “there’s nothing new in it that’s not done in other programs. I think that’s going to help a lot.”\nAs Breaking D readers know\n, the\n2021 spending bill\nslashed the Air Force’s ABMS request in half: to $159 million from the requested $302 million. The congressional report (Section D of the omnibus spending package) explains the move by citing, among other defects, “poor justification materials.”\nLegacy and Future\nIn response to my question about his legacy, Roper said that if he could see one of his efforts carried forward by the Air Force it would be “innovation culture.” That culture — which he has pushed via myriad vectors such as the new software factories, aggressive use of alternative acquisition methods, building a pool of new commercial providers by courting startups — “has been so difficult to build within the Air Force,” he said. “It is like water through a very dense sponge: it’s easy to get the top wet and the bottom wet, but getting it all the way through the middle takes tons of work and energy on the part of leadership. … It can be killed so very quickly with the wrong influences, especially from leadership. That’s what I would truly wish,” he said.\nRoper wouldn’t comment on whether he might be tapped — and willing to accept —\na new position within the Biden Pentagon\n, or any other future job. However, he didn’t sound like a man ready to rest on his laurels; indeed, he seemed to be making a case for why the new administration might just want to keep him around.\n“Right now I don’t know. I’ve made it through one administration transition — I served much longer in the Obama administration than I have in this one,” he said. “And I’m not a political person. I don’t get involved in politics — and I certainly have personal views on them, very strong ones — but the reason I come to work every day is to bring the technical knowledge that I have and the ability to hopefully lead change and innovation in government, as well as a focus on China. …. China is going to be here for the long term, past any single administration.\n“They have a plan to knock us off the top, and that is why I came into defense. That is why I work so hard at this. And no matter what I do in future, that is what I want to be a part of some way of helping tip the scales back towards the US’s favor, whether that is inside of government or not.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The F-35 fighter jet’s exorbitant life-cycle costs means the Air Force cannot afford to buy as many aircraft as it needs to fight and win a war today, which makes the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program all the more important, says outgoing Air Force acquisition czar Will Roper.</p>\n<p>“I think the F-35 program is a long way from being at a sustainment point that we need. I think it’s a long way from being an affordable fighter that we can buy in bulk,” he told reporters today.</p>\n<p>“That’s the reason why Next-Generation Air Dominance is so important to the Air Force,” he said. “It doesn’t just represent a next-generation fighter with bells and whistles that we will need in warfighting. It doesn’t just represent a completely different acquisition paradigm. It also represents a chance to design an airplane that is more sustainable than the F-35 if, in fact, the F-35 cannot get its cost-per-flying-hour down.”</p>\n\n<p>Roper would not be drawn on whether the Air Force was considering downsizing it plan to build a total inventory of 1,763 F-35s — with the Air Force requesting 48 aircraft in 2021, and planning to ask for the same annual buy for the foreseeable future, <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-military-forces-fy-2021-air-force\">according to a study last month by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</a> “But what I can say is we’re not at the sustainment price point we need to be for a very large fleet. So, the next few years are critical for the F 35 program,” he added.</p>\n<p>He seemed to suggest that, all things considered, perhaps the answer is to turn to NGAD to more rapidly build a wartime-fit fighter fleet.</p>\n\n<p>“I very much hope for the future of the program, but I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t prepare for the worst. And so you can see that the movements that we have made in the TacAir portfolio have set the Air Force up to have options, so that our eggs are not in one proverbial basket,” he said.</p>\n<p>Roper explained that Air Force fighters have to be ready to establish air dominance on day one of a war (along with satellites to secure establish communications.) “If they don’t win the day, then there will be no time for the rest of the services to join.” This is why the quantity of F-35s available matters, he said, as well as the quality of its capabilities.</p>\n\n \n<p>“As to the quality, I think everyone feels pleased as the F-35 goes through testing, but it’s very much focused on Block Four as the next step that has to be taken. Quantity goes directly to whether the cost-per-flying-hour can come down,” he said. “And right now the F-35 has a good ‘sticker price,’ but its cost of ownership is not where it needs to be, making the quantities that the Air Force may need to purchase in question.”</p>\n<p>Prime contractor Lockheed Martin’s ongoing Block 4 update includes both hardware and software to enable the aircraft with faster computers, more missiles, a panoramic cockpit display, longer ranges, as well as the capability to team with drones.

{"title": "Congress, It’s Time For Two-Year Budget Deal: Eaglen At AEI", "publish_time": "2021-01-10 21:58:35", "author": ["Mackenzie Eaglen"], "content": "224 lives. $11.6 billion. 186 aircraft.\nThat is the cost over seven short years of more than 6,000 U.S. training and other non-combat military aviation mishaps. The\nrecent report\nof\nThe National Commission on Military Aviation Safety\nsums up the deadly consequences of inadequate action and urgency.\nThe commissioners were “deeply troubled by the chronic fatigue” among servicemembers. They found a “relentless” current operations tempo “is leading to unsafe practices and (is) driving experienced aviators and maintainers out” of service.\nThe commission offered Congress five immediate steps to take to halt the tragic loss of lives in avoidable and preventable accidents:\nReduce demands on forces;\n“Pilots should fly;\nMaintainers should maintain;\nData can save lives; and,\nFunding should be consistent.”\nIt’s that last one that really matters right now, as we start a new administration and a new Congress. While no one mourns the end of the Budget Control Act (BCA), its absence creates a fiscal vacuum and an absence of leadership from both parties to offer solutions soon could mean all spending bills to fund the government will get swept up into the debt ceiling negotiations leading up to the July deadline. Congress should seek a two-year budget deal for all federal agencies for stability of government—and governance. The exhausted troops are counting on it.\nIn Search of a Two-Year Budget Deal\nThe incoming administration is eagerly pushing the goal of another COVID-19 stimulus bill to pass immediately upon taking office. As this legislation takes shape, leaders would be wise to start planning ahead for how to keep spending bills moving on time and in regular order. This is critical to avoid a government shutdown or spending freeze to start the next fiscal year, as has\nso often been the case\nover the past decade.\nWith Democrats taking control in a sweep of both Congress and the White House, members are scrambling to figure out the way ahead. In a\nsplit\nRepublican party, the battle is beginning between budget hawks and defense hawks. It’s not clear yet how the party will square this.\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee is poised to carve out a way ahead that both parties can live with. Given that the committee is under split control, this likely means an active minority with more rights, equal budgets and solid relations among staffers. The committee has a full agenda with military nominations, civilian Pentagon nominations and posture hearings for the 2022 budget request.\nBut the president elect’s budget is likely to be delayed, as is standard with a new administration. It will also take time for the Biden administration to build its national security and defense strategies. In the absence of a new defense strategy, the most logical route for Congress would be to plan a two-year budget deal that buys back readiness and investment lost to the Budget Control Act. While the three-year “Trump bump” for defense\nstarted this necessary repair\n, the foundation of the force remains frayed. The Commission on Military Aviation Safety assessment is only the most disturbing reminder of this fact.\nBuy Back BCA’s Damage\nRepairing the military’s foundation after two decades of war followed by the Budget Control Act and on top of a peace dividend and procurement holiday is taking longer than expected. Throw on top of that, spending freezes to start nearly every fiscal year of the past decade and the result is, in the words of the National Defense Strategy Commission, “America has significantly weakened its own defense.” The commission rightly characterizes the steep defense spending cuts under the BCA as having “pronounced detrimental effects on the size, modernization, and readiness of the military.”\nThe military has to restore and refresh its combat power at the same time it rebuilds readiness and invests in technology. To fix the foundation of the health, readiness and lethality of the force, Congress should seek to restore the hundreds of billions of dollars lost to the Budget Control Act over the next five years. Accounting for the investments made by the outgoing administration above former President Obama’s plans of about $313 billion—with a crude and generous estimate of about half going to fix readiness—this equates to at least $77 billion additional per year needed for the Defense Department above current projections to match need.\nSource: National Defense Strategy Commission report, at\nhttps://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2018-11/providing-for-the-common-defense.pdf\nKeeping with the decorum of various deals from the Obama years, defense hawks should seek these needed buyback funds at parity (1:1) with equal non-defense discretionary increases as part of the two-year budget agreement covering fiscal year 2022 and 2023.\nStability Benefits Everyone\nThe benefits of such a spending deal are numerous—including decoupling funding the government from increasing the debt ceiling, avoiding a spending freeze to start the year, removing the threat of a government shutdown, and giving planners predictability and stability in performing their duties at the most reasonable cost for the taxpayer. For the Senate Armed Services Committee, in particular, a spending deal that keeps legislation and appropriations moving on schedule means more time for essential oversight of the Pentagon. For the troops, it means avoiding another\ntragic year like 2017\n. As then-Secretary of Defense\nJim Mattis put it\nbefore Congress while secretary of defense, “it took us years to get into this situation. It will require years of stable budgets and increased funding to get out of it.”\nA two-year budget agreement would also allow time for another Simpson-Bowles-like commission or Super Committee to stand up and get to work on bigger, bipartisan, and implementable ideas for meaningful debt reduction following the $3 trillion-plus\nCovid debt bomb\nof 2020.

They found a “relentless” current operations tempo “is leading to unsafe practices and (is) driving experienced aviators and maintainers out” of service.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-61592\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/mackenzie-eaglen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/mackenzie-eaglen.jpg 200w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/mackenzie-eaglen-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\"/>The commission offered Congress five immediate steps to take to halt the tragic loss of lives in avoidable and preventable accidents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce demands on forces;</li>\n<li>“Pilots should fly;</li>\n<li>Maintainers should maintain;</li>\n<li>Data can save lives; and,</li>\n<li>Funding should be consistent.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It’s that last one that really matters right now, as we start a new administration and a new Congress. While no one mourns the end of the Budget Control Act (BCA), its absence creates a fiscal vacuum and an absence of leadership from both parties to offer solutions soon could mean all spending bills to fund the government will get swept up into the debt ceiling negotiations leading up to the July deadline. Congress should seek a two-year budget deal for all federal agencies for stability of government—and governance. The exhausted troops are counting on it.</p>\n<p>In Search of a Two-Year Budget Deal</p>\n\n \n<p>The incoming administration is eagerly pushing the goal of another COVID-19 stimulus bill to pass immediately upon taking office. As this legislation takes shape, leaders would be wise to start planning ahead for how to keep spending bills moving on time and in regular order. This is critical to avoid a government shutdown or spending freeze to start the next fiscal year, as has <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/articles/1000-days-continuing-resolutions-10-years/\">so often been the case</a> over the past decade.</p>\n<p>With Democrats taking control in a sweep of both Congress and the White House, members are scrambling to figure out the way ahead. In a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-splits-over-post-trump-path-11610147555\">split</a> Republican party, the battle is beginning between budget hawks and defense hawks. It’s not clear yet how the party will square this.</p>\n<p>The Senate Armed Services Committee is poised to carve out a way ahead that both parties can live with. Given that the committee is under split control, this likely means an active minority with more rights, equal budgets and solid relations among staffers. The committee has a full agenda with military nominations, civilian Pentagon nominations and posture hearings for the 2022 budget request.</p>\n<p>But the president elect’s budget is likely to be delayed, as is standard with a new administration. It will also take time for the Biden administration to build its national security and defense strategies. In the absence of a new defense strategy, the most logical route for Congress would be to plan a two-year budget deal that buys back readiness and investment lost to the Budget Control Act. While the three-year “Trump bump” for defense <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/foreign-and-defense-policy/commander-in-chief-might-want-to-check-with-his-military-before-taking-a-victory-lap/\">started this necessary repair</a>, the foundation of the force remains frayed. The Commission on Military Aviation Safety assessment is only the most disturbing reminder of this fact.</p>\n<em>Buy Back BCA’s Damage</em>\n<p>Repairing the military’s foundation after two decades of war followed by the Budget Control Act and on top of a peace dividend and procurement holiday is taking longer than expected. Throw on top of that, spending freezes to start nearly every fiscal year of the past decade and the result is, in the words of the National Defense Strategy Commission, “America has significantly weakened its own defense.” The commission rightly characterizes the steep defense spending cuts under the BCA as having “pronounced detrimental effects on the size, modernization, and readiness of the military.”</p>\n<p>The military has to restore and refresh its combat power at the same time it rebuilds readiness and invests in technology. To fix the foundation of the health, readiness and lethality of the force, Congress should seek to restore the hundreds of billions of dollars lost to the Budget Control Act over the next five years. Accounting for the investments made by the outgoing administration above former President Obama’s plans of about $313 billion—with a crude and generous estimate of about half going to fix readiness—this equates to at least $77 billion additional per year needed for the Defense Department above current projections to match need.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-134405\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Eaglen-01_09_2021.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Eaglen-01_09_2021.png 640w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Eaglen-01_09_2021-300x169.png 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Eaglen-01_09_2021-210x118.png 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"/></p>\n<em>Source: National Defense Strategy Commission report, at </em><a href=\"https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2018-11/providing-for-the-common-defense.pdf\"><em>https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2018-11/providing-for-the-common-defense.pdf</em></a>\n<p>Keeping with the decorum of various deals from the Obama years, defense hawks should seek these needed buyback funds at parity (1:1) with equal non-defense discretionary increases as part of the two-year budget agreement covering fiscal year 2022 and 2023.</p>\n<p>Stability Benefits Everyone</p>\n<p>The benefits of such a spending deal are numerous—including decoupling funding the government from increasing the debt ceiling, avoiding a spending freeze to start the year, removing the threat of a government shutdown, and giving planners predictability and stability in performing their duties at the most reasonable cost for the taxpayer. For the Senate Armed Services Committee, in particular, a spending deal that keeps legislation and appropriations moving on schedule means more time for essential oversight of the Pentagon. For the troops, it means avoiding another <a href=\"https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2017/09/07/americas_new_deadliest_war_is_hiding_in_plain_sight_112244.html\">tragic year like 2017</a>.

It will require years of stable budgets and increased funding to get out of it.”</p>\n<p>A two-year budget agreement would also allow time for another Simpson-Bowles-like commission or Super Committee to stand up and get to work on bigger, bipartisan, and implementable ideas for meaningful debt reduction following the $3 trillion-plus <a href=\"http://www.crfb.org/blogs/breaking-down-3-4-trillion-covid-relief\">Covid debt bomb</a> of 2020.

AI Slays Top F-16 Pilot In DARPA Dogfight Simulation\nIt’s not too much of a surprise that the top story of 2020, by the redoubtable Theresa Hitchens, is about one of the hottest topics in defense: can artificial intelligence defeat a human pilot. Sure, there’ll be arguments about whether the game was rigged, how it was rigged, whether the human pilot was freed to do all the miraculous things a human can do when lucky and gifted, but the fact is that the human pilot got wiped.\n2.

Dave Deptula’s thoughts about how\nfifth generation aircraft could\nhelp make a (relatively) quick thing of a war with Iran came in at number 6.\n7.

A big spike for a story done seven years ago about a forever war that America supposedly doesn’t care much about anymore. Could this be a Reddit pickup?\n8. US Navy Rushes Its Sub-Hunting Helicopters To India, Eye On China\nPaul McLeary scoops up number 8 with a\npiece about the great power rivalry\nbetween the US, India and China, as we rushed sub-hunting helos to India to help keep tabs on China’s expanding sub fleet.\n9. A-10: Hey Air Force, There’s More to Survival than Hiding\nComing in at number 9 is another popular op-ed piece, this time by A-10 pilot Brian Boeding who argues that his plane really is the bees knees when it comes to providing\nREAL Close Air Support\n.\n10. OMFV: The Army’s Polish Bridge Problem\nFinally, in grand fashion, Mr. Army (Sydney Freedberg) wows with\nhis coverage of a strategically important and almost completely overlooked issue\n, the challenges of building a modern armored vehicle (the\nOptionally Manned Fighting Vehicle\n) that provides up-to-date protection, fire power and space for passengers while still being light enough to cross relatively flimsy bridges that cross central Europe’s many rivers.\nThe list is an impressive marker of the breadth of topics we cover as we chronicle the strategy, policy and politics that decide the weapons America and its allies buy, and how we use them.

He has made clear that the United States plans to return to the JCPOA, which it left in 2018, and lift sanctions that were imposed on Iran as part of the outgoing administration’s ‘maximum pressure’ policy, in exchange for Iran’s returning to the framework of the deal and faithfully meeting all its obligations,” they write. “The United States return to the JCPOA is meant to be a starting point for resuming negotiations with Iran on a range of issues, some of which relate to the existing deal, and others, such as surface-to-surface missiles and Iran’s regional conduct, are issues that were not addressed in the agreement.”\nThat is likely to make the powers who helped negotiate the agreement happy, the authors say: “The European Western powers even hope to coordinate positions with the new administration beyond the decision-in-principle to return to the deal.”\nBut the Israelis want to make sure the Biden Administration know the facts, that the Iranians are not letting international inspectors enter some of their underground facilities. And they should know that when the Iranians say publicly they will enrich to 20%, they plan to enrich to a higher grade.

Another acquaintance is Anthony Blinken, expected to serve as Secretary of State.</p>\n\n<p>The Israelis are already worrying that the Biden administration may not be as hard-line as President Trump has been with the Iranians.</p>\n<p>“The Iranians are masters of creating fake reality, and I think that the new administration is going to buy their lies,” Yossi Kuperwasser, former head of the research division in the Israeli Defense Forces’ military intelligence division and director general of the Israel Ministry of Strategic Affairs. “The Iranians are masters of creating fake reality and I think that the new administration is going to buy their lies ”</p>\n\n \n<p>Amos Gilead, former chief of the IDF’s intelligence research and analysis division, told BD that every effort should be made to totally block Iran’s race to nuclear capability: “A country like Iran, with its ideology, should not reach the point where it can act with nuclear weapons.”</p>\n<p>He told BD that going back to the existing <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/joint-comprehensive-plan-of-action-jcpoa/\">Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)</a> agreement with Iran would result in “some dozens” of nuclear devices in Iran hands within 10 years.</p>\n<p>A new paper authored by Eldad Shavit and Sima Shine, senior researchers at the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), argues that the Biden administration is likely to return to the JCPOA.</p>\n<p>“Biden vehemently criticized Trump’s Iran policy. He has made clear that the United States plans to return to the JCPOA, which it left in 2018, and lift sanctions that were imposed on Iran as part of the outgoing administration’s ‘maximum pressure’ policy, in exchange for Iran’s returning to the framework of the deal and faithfully meeting all its obligations,” they write. “The United States return to the JCPOA is meant to be a starting point for resuming negotiations with Iran on a range of issues, some of which relate to the existing deal, and others, such as surface-to-surface missiles and Iran’s regional conduct, are issues that were not addressed in the agreement.”</p>\n<p>That is likely to make the powers who helped negotiate the agreement happy, the authors say: “The European Western powers even hope to coordinate positions with the new administration beyond the decision-in-principle to return to the deal.”</p>\n<p>But the Israelis want to make sure the Biden Administration know the facts, that the Iranians are not letting international inspectors enter some of their underground facilities. And they should know that when the Iranians say publicly they will enrich to 20%, they plan to enrich to a higher grade. Finally, they aren’t telling the truth about the number of centrifuges they’ve got. And Yossi Cohen is, presumably, here with the evidence.</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["iran", "Iranian nuclear program", "Jake Sullivan", "Joe Biden transition", "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA", "Mossad", "Wendy Sherman", "William Burns", "Yosi Cohen"], "categories": [], "img_data": [{"img_url": "https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-01-at-12.10.28-PM-1024x467.png", "img_describe": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with then-national security advisor Yosef “Yossi” Cohen, now director of Mossad.", "img_name": "news/img_2021_07_21_60f798d5435cc49f1f88d727.png"}], "video_data": [], "url": "https://breakingdefense.com/2021/01/mossad-head-briefs-biden-admin-on-iranian-nukes-missiles/", "site_name": "breakingdefense", "insert_time": "2021-07-21 11:47:33"}

He did an excellent job of looking ahead, identifying cyber and related IT vulnerabilities as a serious threat very early on, pressing hard to sculpt a fundamentally new defense trade relationship with America’s allies and managing the budget during one of the toughest times in modern American history. So Hicks has big shoes to fill.\nHamre offered Hicks a strong\nendorsement\nin a formal statement earlier today:\n“I held that job and know what it takes to succeed. Dr. Hicks is a superb choice for this important job. She has the discipline, intellect, and organizational skill to make the Department work effectively for the Secretary.

Her nomination as DepSecDef will answer some of those who pushed hard for Biden to nominate a female Defense Secretary, which he did not do.\nAustin is also notoriously uncomfortable with Congress, where he was once\npublicly savaged by the late Sen.

The HAT system is a distributed command, control, communications, computers and intelligence network developed by Raytheon.\n“Systems like the Air Defense Operations Center (ADOC) for example are uniquely able to provide expanded capability against sophisticated, regional threats.” a Raytheon spokesperson said.\nBack in 2004, the U.S. Air Force awarded Raytheon an undefinitized contract action (UCA) for a Foreign Military Sales contract not to exceed $75.6 million to design and implement an Air and Missile Defense Operation Center for Qatar, the first of its kind in the region.\n“ADOC can complement existing systems to provide significantly extended situational awareness and deliver actionable information to commanders,” the spokesperson added.\nThis comes at a time when the Houthis are attacking Saudi oil facilities and military sites, including the petroleum products distribution terminal in Jizan, in southwest Saudi Arabia near the Yemeni border. This attack comes on the heels of another in 2019 on the Kingdom’s Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities run by Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil giant.\n“With the new types of unexpected threats, we are forced to think seriously about different approaches to improve our decision making, and most importantly, early warning capabilities,” said Khalid Al Bu-Ainain Al Mazrouei, advisor to the deputy supreme commander of UAE Armed Forces in a recent conference I attended.\n“It is vital to sustain the region’s command and control centers to effectively counter all kinds of well-organized threats,” Al Mazrouei added, a complicated process that requires a “strong chain of command, a better shared awareness picture between GCC states, and an improved ISR and EW capability and effectiveness.”\nHow To Do It\nKuwaiti defense expert Ali Al Hashim said the complex regional situation requires radical moves.\n“Given the vastness of the Saudi land, the country must deploy a fair amount of AWACS aircraft, ground radars and the Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS), a low-level airborne ground surveillance system that uses moored balloons as radar platforms,” he explained, which is “a challenging task.”\nHence, “Gulf countries could mimic the work of the US Central Command located in Al Udeid air base in Qatar where they can standardize the whole systems and eventually be able to operate them in one\neffective C4ISR environment\n,” he said.\nHe also added that common purchases and joint trainings will help Gulf countries achieve their goal and eventually protect themselves against the Iranian threats. “This could be a chance to work on common military standards and optimize mission effectiveness,” he told me.\nTo make it happen, they will need to build a centralized command center linked to sub-command centers spread across all countries and able to share and receive data in a synchronized real time, or at least semi-real time way, Mohamed Al-Kenany, military researcher and defense analyst at the Arab Forum for Policy Analysis in Cairo, says\n“These centers could be built on C5I solutions and connected to early warning stations and air defense systems like the Patriot and THAAD and related radars for early warning and tracking missiles and air targets,” he explains. “In case any station gets attacked, the command center connected to it will automatically notify the main command center and other sub-centers, which will ultimately save time and effort and secure the speed in identifying the target and efficiency processing the info.”\nHowever, this could only be achieved through a proper network-centric warfare technology that integrates ground stations and airborne command and control centers, like the AWACS and ISR aircraft, and connects with naval ships equipped with combat management systems and early warning radars, Al-Kinany told me.\n“This would provide shared awareness that increases synergy for command and control, resulting in superior decision-making and the ability to coordinate complex military operations over long distances for an overwhelming war-fighting advantage,” he said.\nBecause the type of threat is now shifting from ballistic missiles to drones and cruise missiles, GCC countries must deploy point short to medium range\nair defense systems\n, electro-optic infrared sensors, and tactical airborne early warning balloons, among others.\n“Electronic warfare systems are also keystone in modern and future warfare for jamming purposes and highly effective against swarm attacks,” he added. “Combining the work of electronic warfare and air defense systems has become essential to form a complete multi-layered defense system.”\nHowever, Al Hashim sees beyond all that: “Let us assume they were able to set and effectively apply a joint integrated defense system,” he said. “The real challenge here is the growing Iranian cybersecurity threat.

This attack comes on the heels of another in 2019 on the Kingdom’s Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities run by Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil giant.</p>\n<p>“With the new types of unexpected threats, we are forced to think seriously about different approaches to improve our decision making, and most importantly, early warning capabilities,” said Khalid Al Bu-Ainain Al Mazrouei, advisor to the deputy supreme commander of UAE Armed Forces in a recent conference I attended.</p>\n<p>“It is vital to sustain the region’s command and control centers to effectively counter all kinds of well-organized threats,” Al Mazrouei added, a complicated process that requires a “strong chain of command, a better shared awareness picture between GCC states, and an improved ISR and EW capability and effectiveness.”</p>\n<p>How To Do It</p>\n<p>Kuwaiti defense expert Ali Al Hashim said the complex regional situation requires radical moves.</p>\n<p>“Given the vastness of the Saudi land, the country must deploy a fair amount of AWACS aircraft, ground radars and the Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS), a low-level airborne ground surveillance system that uses moored balloons as radar platforms,” he explained, which is “a challenging task.”</p>\n<p>Hence, “Gulf countries could mimic the work of the US Central Command located in Al Udeid air base in Qatar where they can standardize the whole systems and eventually be able to operate them in one <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/12/iran-missile-upgrades-complicate-gcc-defense-efforts/\">effective C4ISR environment</a>,” he said.</p>\n<p>He also added that common purchases and joint trainings will help Gulf countries achieve their goal and eventually protect themselves against the Iranian threats. “This could be a chance to work on common military standards and optimize mission effectiveness,” he told me.</p>\n<p>To make it happen, they will need to build a centralized command center linked to sub-command centers spread across all countries and able to share and receive data in a synchronized real time, or at least semi-real time way, Mohamed Al-Kenany, military researcher and defense analyst at the Arab Forum for Policy Analysis in Cairo, says</p>\n<p>“These centers could be built on C5I solutions and connected to early warning stations and air defense systems like the Patriot and THAAD and related radars for early warning and tracking missiles and air targets,” he explains. “In case any station gets attacked, the command center connected to it will automatically notify the main command center and other sub-centers, which will ultimately save time and effort and secure the speed in identifying the target and efficiency processing the info.”</p>\n<p>However, this could only be achieved through a proper network-centric warfare technology that integrates ground stations and airborne command and control centers, like the AWACS and ISR aircraft, and connects with naval ships equipped with combat management systems and early warning radars, Al-Kinany told me.</p>\n<p>“This would provide shared awareness that increases synergy for command and control, resulting in superior decision-making and the ability to coordinate complex military operations over long distances for an overwhelming war-fighting advantage,” he said.</p>\n<p>Because the type of threat is now shifting from ballistic missiles to drones and cruise missiles, GCC countries must deploy point short to medium range <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/02/uaes-first-air-defense-missile-to-be-used-on-german-oerlikon-skynex/\">air defense systems</a>, electro-optic infrared sensors, and tactical airborne early warning balloons, among others.</p>\n<p>“Electronic warfare systems are also keystone in modern and future warfare for jamming purposes and highly effective against swarm attacks,” he added. “Combining the work of electronic warfare and air defense systems has become essential to form a complete multi-layered defense system.”</p>\n<p>However, Al Hashim sees beyond all that: “Let us assume they were able to set and effectively apply a joint integrated defense system,” he said. “The real challenge here is the growing Iranian cybersecurity threat. Iran has some of the best cyber warfare means and will be able to manipulate our IAD structure.”</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["Belt of Cooperation", "C4ISR environment", "C4ISR Middle East", "early warning capabilities", "Gulf Cooperation Council", "Houthis", "ISR capabilities", "patriot missile", "Saudi oil facilities", "situational awareness", "thaad", "UAE armed forces"], "categories": [], "img_data": [{"img_url": "https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/THAAD-battery-launcher.jpg", "img_describe": "THAAD Battery Launcher.

Gen. Walter Rugen, FVL director for Army Futures Command. But, he said “that’s kind of a false choice,” because the Army has learned to be cost-conscious from the cancellation of the Comanche back in 2004.\n“Compare and contrast it with the prototyping effort we did with Comanche where [we spent], inflation adjusted, about $9 billion to get to the [two] prototypes,” Rugen told AUSA’s Global Force Next conference Wednesday morning. “We’re at a little over $7 billion to get\n18\nprototypes out on FARA and FLRAA,” the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft to replace the UH-60 Black Hawk.\n[UPDATE:\nThese figures sum up over a decade of development in each case, Rugen explained in a followup email. “Both numbers — Comanche & FARA//FLRAA — represent over a decade of investment and capability development in these complex weapon systems,” he told me. “It is the full life cycle of the development activity. For FLRAA and FARA, [it’s] less resource intensive.”\n]\n“And that is because industry has significant skin in the game,” Rugen said. “They spend their dollars very wisely.”\nIn other words, private companies have invested a lot of their own money developing Future Vertical Lift aircraft.

Sikorsky built its S-97 Raider, essentially a FARA prototype, entirely at its own expense.\nThe other big difference from the Comanche debacle, Rugen argued, is that there’s far less competition within the Army’s aviation budget. In\n1996\n, when the Comanche first took flight, the Army was also trying to upgrade a host of existing aircraft, many of them bought during the Reagan buildup: AH-64 Apache gunships, UH-60A Black Hawk transports, CH-47C Chinook heavy lifters, and OH-58C Kiowa Warrior scouts. By 2004, with the Iraq War raging, the Army decided to prioritize the four near-term upgrades over the longer-term, higher-tech Comanche.\n“It’s not that we couldn’t do one with Comanche, it’s we couldn’t do five [modernization programs at once],” Rugen said. “Late this decade, we’ll be doing two.”\nOnly two, truly? Yes, Rugen said, because – unlike in the 1990s and early 2000s – the current helicopter fleet is thoroughly modernized and doesn’t need a massive investment in upgrades.\nRugen didn’t list models, but that modernized “enduring force” includes AH-64E Apaches; UH-60L, M, and V-model Black Hawks; and CH-47F Chinooks (both Block I and Block II). The service has actually tried to stop buying new Chinooks but was overruled by Congress. (The service is acquiring\na new tactical drone, FTUAS\n, but that’s much less expensive than a new manned aircraft).\nNow, the Army still wants to upgrade its existing aircraft and backfit new technologies developed for FVL onto Apaches, Black Hawks, and Chinooks. But it has a new strategy for upgrades, too, known as Modular Open Systems Architecture (MOSA). In essence, instead of each upgrade being its own bespoke redesign, with extensive testing, the Army aims to plug-and-play new technologies from any vendor with relative ease, as long as each component meets certain common technical standards. The FVL aircraft will be built around a MOSA approach from the ground up, but the Army’s also working to implement a partial form of MOSA on its existing aircraft.\n“On the enduring fleet, it’s going to be an incremental approach,” not a big-bang all at once, cautioned Brig.

{"title": "Exclusive: DARPA ‘Likely’ To Demo Only 2 Blackjack Payloads", "publish_time": "2021-05-20 20:55:38", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: While DARPA’s\nBlackjack program\ncurrently is exploring a handful of different payloads for small, cheap, low-flying satellites, only two are “likely” to be chosen to fly, says Stephen Forbes, program manager. Those are a radio-frequency package, and a missile warning sensor.\n“I’m going to let the technical decisions drive that [choice], but I can say that, at the end of the day, we’ll probably end up with two different configurations … two different payloads,” Forbes explained in an interview.\nWhile Forbes said nothing is set in stone under the multi-faceted effort, the Blackjack satellites probably will end up carrying a radio frequency (RF) system capable of both communications and geolocation, and an overhead persistent infrared (OPIR) missile warning payload. (Geolocation involves using radio signals to detect targets, and even track moving vehicles.)\n“Those are actually our primary payloads that we intend to demonstrate,” he said, noting that each of those payloads would probably require a different bus design. This is because the requirements for satellite subcomponents such as antennas are different based on payload types.\nThe high-profile program is widely seen by the satellite industry as a boot-strap into a lucrative DoD market for smallsats in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). DoD sees LEO constellations as potentially providing a host of services to warfighters in highly-contested conflict zones — both as alternatives to today’s uber-expensive handful of milsats, and as a foundation for\nJoint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2).\nMore than a dozen companies — from defense behemoths to tiny startups — are currently under Blackjack contracts.\nProgram goals\nBlackjack is designed to redesign commercial technology and manufacturing practices for building small, cheap, low-orbiting satellites for military uses. The program’s specific goals are:\nDevelop payload and mission-level autonomy software and demonstrate autonomous orbital operations including on-orbit distributed decision processors.\nDevelop and implement advanced commercial manufacturing for military payloads and the spacecraft bus.\nDemonstrate payloads in LEO to augment [national security space] assets.\n“We’re still not focused on a specific mission,” Forbes explained. “We’re not trying to solve specific capability gaps or technical gaps, related to a specific sensor payload, which is why you continue to see a broad swath of contracts and other activities ongoing with the program because of that architecture,” he said.\nThus, up to now, Blackjack has been exploring multiple types of payloads and multiple bus designs from multiple companies.\nFurther, he added: “If there’s opportunities to get more payloads on orbit by by putting two payloads on one bus, we may we may look at that,” he said. “But if it becomes where that starts to drive cost or schedule, we’ll go into separate configurations.”\nAnother, perhaps even more important, factor that could pique Blackjack to switch directions regarding payloads, he explained, is whether or not demand signals from military users changes.\n“We’ve made the conscious effort to focus on tactical with this program,” Forbes said. “We really focused on payloads that had tactical utility, because they were an underserved market.”\nThe Army, in particular, has been pushing for years to get more fast access to satellite data to inform tactical decisions — with commanders begging for everything from\nmore reliable communications\nin places like the mountains of Afghanistan, to assured\npositioning, navigation and timing (PNT)\nsignals in conflict zones where GPS is unavailable or jammed, to even asking for it’s own\nISR\nimagery and data, which currently is provided to it by the NRO and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.\nThe Army is one of the potential “transition partners” for Blackjack, along with the\nSpace Development Agency (SDA)\nand the Space Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center, which will soon morph into the new\nSpace Systems Command.\nForbes wasn’t about to\nwade into that potential food fight,\nand to be fair, he really has no reason to do so.\n“Space acquisition, especially when it comes to LEO, is going to be resolved at a pay grade much higher than mine,” he said with a laugh. “So, I’m in the fortunate situation where — since Blackjack is focused on the architecture — to me it doesn’t really matter who acquires the architecture.”\nIndeed, when DARPA started Blackjack in 2017, the space environment was fundamentally different. Since then, DoD has formed Space Command and the Space Force, and concerns have grown about the vulnerability of US space assets to interference and/or attack by Russia, China and others. Meanwhile, the commercial space sector has exploded, especially with regard to the use of LEO sats for everything from high-speed comms to imagery to even signals intelligence-like capabilities (such as RF geolocation) once closely held by NRO.\nSo, Forbes explained, the original goal of Blackjack was to bring as many types of payloads, busses, propulsion systems, and constellation designs as possible into the proof of concept. Phase One of the program, now concluded, was aimed at bringing multiple ideas through design review, he explained, and allow DoD customers to check them out against needs.\nKeeping DARPA’s options — and those of potential users — open remains a concern, he said. “We want to make sure we don’t cut off promising development efforts too early,” he said.\nProgram enters Phase 2\nNow, as Blackjack moves into its second phase, DARPA is funding a more than a dozen contractors, each working on a different technology set. Not all those contracts will result in products that make it to orbit, Forbes stressed.\nNor do the contract face values represent real dollars, in that each individual contract includes options for equipping up to 20 satellites. Thus, he explained (to our dismay), it doesn’t work to simply add up the value of contract announcements to figure out the overall Blackjack budget, which currently is being kept secret. And while DARPA allows contractors to disclose certain contract parameters, not all companies choose to do disclose anything at all.\nPrimes\nLockheed Martin was chosen as the prime\nintegrator of payloads and satellites for Phase 1\nof Blackjack last April; this April it won a follow-on contract modification worth\n$27.3 million for Phase II integration\n(for a total of $40.4 million).\nTwo companies,\nSEAKR\nEngineering and Scientific Systems Co. Inc (SSCI), were both awarded Phase 1 contract; SEAKR in March won the follow-on contract worth up to $60.4 million for Phase 2 and Phase 3 development of (and integration of payloads into) the\nPit Boss\ncloud-based, autonomous mission management system for the constellation.\nBus contracts\nThere are three contractors working on Phase 2 bus designs, according to a list provided to\nBreaking D\nby DARPA: Blue Canyon Technologies, Telesat and Airbus US.\nIn February, Blue Canyon (now a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies) won a contract worth up to $26.5 million to potentially build six more standardized satellite buses, as a second installment in a contract awarded last year for $14.1 million to produce four. Telesat last October won\n$18.3 million to produce two busses.\nAirbus announced in 2019 that it had won a bus contract for an unspecified amount of money to produce an unspecified number of busses.\nPayload contracts\nThree contractors have won awards to build different types of RF payloads: SEAKR; Systems & Technology Research,\nunder a 2020 award worth up to $79.5 million\n; and Augustus Aerospace Co., a tiny Colorado-based startup working on a payload designed to meet Army Space and Missile Defense Command needs under an undisclosed award.\nTwo contractors, Raytheon (under a contract worth up to\n$37.4 million issued last June),\nand optical-system specialists Danbury Mission Technologies (contract undisclosed) have won awards for OPIR payloads designed to track missiles.\nNorthrop Grumman Mission Systems is working on an alternate PNT system,\nunder a just announced $13.3 million Phase 2 contract for development of two payloads.\nL3Harris was contracted in May 2020 to develop an electro-optical/infrared payload for missile warning, again, with the parameters not disclosed. However,\ncolleague Nathan Strout reported\nthat the company lost out on a follow-on Blackjack contract to Raytheon (see above).\nFinally, SA Photonics is developing optical inter-satellite links (OSILs) for the\nMandrake 2\nexperimental satellites under a Blackjack contract — satellites that are\nspecifically aimed at demonstrating capability\nfor SDA’s\nNational Defense Space Architecture.\nForbes explained that DARPA is continuing to fund development of the OSIL payloads, but that the rationale has changed — because the commercial industry isn’t as far along in development of the underlying technology as DARPA and SDA originally thought.\n“They have really moved from less of a payload for a tactical user” to instead being seen as “a critical enabling technology for Leo constellations,” he said. DoD “realized that we couldn’t rely on the commercial folks to be there on our schedule, and it was a place where the DoD needed to make an investment to ensure that we had the communication links between the satellite to support the architecture.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-53447\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/DARPA-blackjack-satellites-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"619\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/DARPA-blackjack-satellites-.jpg 619w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/DARPA-blackjack-satellites--300x153.jpg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/DARPA-blackjack-satellites--210x107.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px\"/>WASHINGTON: While DARPA’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/blackjack-program/\">Blackjack program</a> currently is exploring a handful of different payloads for small, cheap, low-flying satellites, only two are “likely” to be chosen to fly, says Stephen Forbes, program manager.

The program’s specific goals are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Develop payload and mission-level autonomy software and demonstrate autonomous orbital operations including on-orbit distributed decision processors.</em></li>\n<li><em>Develop and implement advanced commercial manufacturing for military payloads and the spacecraft bus.</em></li>\n<li><em>Demonstrate payloads in LEO to augment [national security space] assets.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>“We’re still not focused on a specific mission,” Forbes explained. “We’re not trying to solve specific capability gaps or technical gaps, related to a specific sensor payload, which is why you continue to see a broad swath of contracts and other activities ongoing with the program because of that architecture,” he said.</p>\n<p>Thus, up to now, Blackjack has been exploring multiple types of payloads and multiple bus designs from multiple companies.</p>\n<p>Further, he added: “If there’s opportunities to get more payloads on orbit by by putting two payloads on one bus, we may we may look at that,” he said. “But if it becomes where that starts to drive cost or schedule, we’ll go into separate configurations.”</p>\n<p>Another, perhaps even more important, factor that could pique Blackjack to switch directions regarding payloads, he explained, is whether or not demand signals from military users changes.</p>\n<p>“We’ve made the conscious effort to focus on tactical with this program,” Forbes said. “We really focused on payloads that had tactical utility, because they were an underserved market.”</p>\n<p>The Army, in particular, has been pushing for years to get more fast access to satellite data to inform tactical decisions — with commanders begging for everything from <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/01/army-needs-unified-network-linking-tactical-home-base-systems-cio/\">more reliable communications</a> in places like the mountains of Afghanistan, to assured <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/03/army-rushes-to-deploy-anti-jam-gps-alternative-for-armored-force/\">positioning, navigation and timing (PNT)</a> signals in conflict zones where GPS is unavailable or jammed, to even asking for it’s own <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/05/exclusive-army-plan-may-loosen-ic-grip-on-sat-based-isr/\">ISR</a> imagery and data, which currently is provided to it by the NRO and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.</p>\n<p>The Army is one of the potential “transition partners” for Blackjack, along with the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/space-development-agency/\">Space Development Agency (SDA)</a> and the Space Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center, which will soon morph into the new <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/space-systems-command/\">Space Systems Command. </a>Forbes wasn’t about to <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/04/darpa-blackjack-wholl-get-prized-satellite-tech-air-force-or-sda/\">wade into that potential food fight,</a> and to be fair, he really has no reason to do so.</p>\n<p>“Space acquisition, especially when it comes to LEO, is going to be resolved at a pay grade much higher than mine,” he said with a laugh. “So, I’m in the fortunate situation where — since Blackjack is focused on the architecture — to me it doesn’t really matter who acquires the architecture.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, when DARPA started Blackjack in 2017, the space environment was fundamentally different. Since then, DoD has formed Space Command and the Space Force, and concerns have grown about the vulnerability of US space assets to interference and/or attack by Russia, China and others. Meanwhile, the commercial space sector has exploded, especially with regard to the use of LEO sats for everything from high-speed comms to imagery to even signals intelligence-like capabilities (such as RF geolocation) once closely held by NRO.</p>\n<p>So, Forbes explained, the original goal of Blackjack was to bring as many types of payloads, busses, propulsion systems, and constellation designs as possible into the proof of concept. Phase One of the program, now concluded, was aimed at bringing multiple ideas through design review, he explained, and allow DoD customers to check them out against needs.</p>\n<p>Keeping DARPA’s options — and those of potential users — open remains a concern, he said. “We want to make sure we don’t cut off promising development efforts too early,” he said.</p>\n<p>Program enters Phase 2</p>\n<p>Now, as Blackjack moves into its second phase, DARPA is funding a more than a dozen contractors, each working on a different technology set. Not all those contracts will result in products that make it to orbit, Forbes stressed.</p>\n<p>Nor do the contract face values represent real dollars, in that each individual contract includes options for equipping up to 20 satellites. Thus, he explained (to our dismay), it doesn’t work to simply add up the value of contract announcements to figure out the overall Blackjack budget, which currently is being kept secret. And while DARPA allows contractors to disclose certain contract parameters, not all companies choose to do disclose anything at all.</p>\n<p>Primes</p>\n<p>Lockheed Martin was chosen as the prime <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/05/the-key-to-all-domain-warfare-is-predictive-analysis-gen-oshaughnessy/\">integrator of payloads and satellites for Phase 1</a> of Blackjack last April; this April it won a follow-on contract modification worth <a href=\"https://news.clearancejobs.com/2021/04/22/lockheed-martin-awarded-phase-2-for-blackjack-satellite-darpa-program/\">$27.3 million for Phase II integration</a> (for a total of $40.4 million).</p>\n<p>Two companies, <a href=\"https://www.seakr.com/?s=DARPA\">SEAKR</a> Engineering and Scientific Systems Co. Inc (SSCI), were both awarded Phase 1 contract; SEAKR in March won the follow-on contract worth up to $60.4 million for Phase 2 and Phase 3 development of (and integration of payloads into) the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/05/the-key-to-all-domain-warfare-is-predictive-analysis-gen-oshaughnessy/\">Pit Boss</a> cloud-based, autonomous mission management system for the constellation.</p>\n<p>Bus contracts</p>\n<p>There are three contractors working on Phase 2 bus designs, according to a list provided to <em>Breaking D</em> by DARPA: Blue Canyon Technologies, Telesat and Airbus US.</p>\n<p>In February, Blue Canyon (now a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies) won a contract worth up to $26.5 million to potentially build six more standardized satellite buses, as a second installment in a contract awarded last year for $14.1 million to produce four.

Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: The Army has redesigned its\nRequest For Proposals\nto replace the Bradley troop carrier to give industry “maximum latitude” to innovate,\nBrig. Gen. Richard Coffman\ntold reporters this morning. It’s even removed all classified data to let foreign companies participate fully. But one thing will be absolutely mandatory: compliance with a new set of technical standards and interfaces – known as a\nModular Open Systems Architecture\n– that the service is developing for all its future combat vehicles.\nMost Infantry Fighting Vehicles on the global market – including\nthe only publicly announced contender, the Rheinmetall Lynx\n– look a lot like the Reagan-era M2 Bradley: They’re tracked machines with a driver in the hull, a commander and gunner in the turret, and five to nine infantry soldiers in the back, transported under armor protection until they jump out for the final assault.\nIn\nprevious attempts to replace the Bradley\n, the Army gave industry rigid requirements, specifying everything from passenger capacity to gun caliber to maximum weight. But the new Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle will be different. While\nthe Army has mandated a crew of two\n, both sitting in the hull with\nan unmanned turret\n, it will let industry’s design teams suggest all the other specs.\n“We’ve got companies out there... that have come and said, hey listen, ‘we don’t want to have to six/eight/10 people in the back. We want to have\ntwo\n, and we want to make a very small vehicle,” said Coffman, the director of Next Generation Combat Vehicles at Army Future Command. “We may need 15 OMFVs to move [a platoon of] 30,” he said, instead of today’s platoon of four Bradleys – and the new RFP would allow that.\n“Or maybe they can find an innovative way to move 10 soldiers with only three vehicles and make it small and light and powerful, I don’t know,” Coffman continued. “Perhaps not every vehicle looks the same. perhaps one has the weapon system on it ... while another is carrying just the soldiers and gear.”\n“We don’t know what each industry partner’s solution will be, but we’re giving them maximum latitude to show us,” he said.\nThe current RFP, for what’s called Phase II of OMFV, asks only for digital “concept designs,” not fully detailed construction plans: The Army will see how these designs perform in simulations, get feedback from actual combat soldiers, and give industry a chance to make changes. At some point, this refinement process will get into classified data, but by that time the Army expects any interested foreign companies to be able to get the necessary clearances.\nThen in 2023, the Army will hold another competition to design (Phase III) and build (Phase IV) actual prototype vehicles. Companies don’t have to win a Phase II concept design award in 2021 to be eligible to compete for the Phase III award in 2023. That said, the Phase II winners will have the advantage of getting to improve their designs with government funding and regular feedback, putting them in prime position for Phase III.\nMeanwhile, in parallel, the Army will start drafting its formal requirements for OMFV. But, Coffman promised, it won’t lock those down before it’s gone through multiple rounds of back and forth with industry over multiple years. That’s a stark contrast to traditional programs – including\nan earlier, cancelled attempt at OMFV\n– that tried to\nprescribe strict performance specifications\nat the start.\n“No decision before its time” is a driving principle of the new program, Coffman said. “Previous programs have required the government to be omniscient, and we all know that we’re\nnot\nomniscient. We can’t predict what’s going to happen in seven years or eight years or nine....so we are not going to put a nail in a single requirement until we have to.”\nBut when those requirements are finalized, they will be as binding as on any old-school program. In fact, in some ways, contractors may find the final requirements\nmore\nrestrictive than they’re used to, because the US government has gotten sick of companies selling it proprietary technology that isn’t compatible with other companies’ products and can only be upgraded by the original manufacturer, for a hefty fee. Instead, over the next several years, it will work with industry to develop technical standards and common interfaces that ensure everything works together and new upgrades are simply plug-and-play.\nSeveral sets of standards already exist, such as the VICTORY architecture used on the latest models of the M1 Abrams and the 8×8 Stryker. But they need to be combined, updated, and expanded to handle the technical complexity, not only of OMFV, but of other future Army combat vehicles.\n“This is broader than just OMFV,” said\nBrig. Gen. Glenn Dean\n, who as Program Executive Officer for Ground Combat Systems (PEO-GCS) will run the program. “This is for combat vehicles in general. Tactical vehicles [i.e. trucks] will share an element of this, and certainly robotic systems.”\nThe Army is already\nexperimenting with Robotic Combat Vehicles\n,\nbuilt by various contractors\nbut using\ncommon autonomy software developed by the Army\n. Parts of that RCV “kernel” may be ported over to OMFV to let it operate unmanned in certain missions – hence the “optionally manned” part of the name. But, Coffman said, “we’ll work with industry if they have a better kernel”: That’s one of the things he’s looking forward to finding out in back-and-forth of OFMV concept designs.\nIt’ll be hard enough developing compatible code and common physical components for use across multiple types of manned and unmanned vehicles. But the Army’s ambitions are bigger than that: In exercises like\nProject Convergence\n, it’s experimenting with\nways for ground vehicles to share tactical data\non\ntargets and threats\nwith\nlong-range artillery\nand\naircraft\n– and it wants to link in foot soldiers as well.\nThe Modular Open Systems Architecture, Dean said, must connect OMFV “seamlessly” to the targeting goggles worn by its infantry passengers,\na militarized Microsoft HoloLens\nknown as the\nIntegrated Visual Augmentation System\n. That will allow the foot troops to see through the vehicle’s sensors and get a better sense of the situation before they get out and expose themselves to fire. (Though Dean didn’t say so, this could work in reverse as well: Once the infantry get out, the vehicle crew could see through the built-in cameras in their goggles, giving them a much wider view).\n“Our combat vehicles need to be architected in such a way that they can not only connect back to the network, but connect to and can feed the IVAS system,” Dean said. “We’re doing some of that effort on Stryker right now... but OMFV needs to be built with that from the ground up.”\nHow important is this kind of technical compatibility across disparate systems? It’s so important that the Army will weigh it as heavily as physical performance in evaluating industry proposals.\n“Industry’s going to be graded principally on two things,” Dean said. One is their approach to meeting\nthe nine broad “characteristics” – from survivability to mobility to ease of training\n– laid out for the OMFV itself. The other is “how are they going to incorporate common Modular Open Systems Architecture?”\nCompanies now have 120 days to submit bids to the government, Dean said. That’s longer than the draft timeline the Army proposed back in July, because companies asked for more time to put together their proposals. (The extra time up front should also cut about two months out of what had been\na four-month gap in the original funding plan\nfor 2023). Meanwhile, in January, the Army will formally launch a new public-private consortium –\nan increasingly common approach\n– to work on MOSA.\n“Industry’s proposals are due back 16th April,” Dean told reporters. “We anticipate contract award in July.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The Army has redesigned its <a href=\"https://beta.sam.gov/opp/57f5461cfa24463995fd91d182476f4d/view?keywords=OMFV&sort=-relevance&index=opp&is_active=true&page=1\">Request For Proposals</a> to replace the Bradley troop carrier to give industry “maximum latitude” to innovate, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/gen.-richard-ross-coffman/\">Brig.

But their effectiveness has a limit: the speed at which people on the ground can access and interpret the data they produce.\nAlmost every one of the satellites on orbit today has a unique ground control station to collect and process its data. And, with 1,100 satellites set to launch annually by 2025, according to MIT Technology Review, the cost and technical challenge for operators across governments and industry could be overwhelming. This is particularly relevant for defense organizations worldwide that are rapidly developing and deploying small satellites and constellations for persistent and resilient networks.\nAt Raytheon Intelligence & Space, a Raytheon Technologies business, we are helping civil and military satellites get the most value possible from their orbiting assets through a command-and-control system that works on any platform, with any sensor from any vendor and on any orbit.\nThrough a single ground system, we can increase the speed and fidelity of data collection. Satellites aren’t communicating only with the ground system; they’re communicating with each other. And, through modern software developments, we’re able to do it faster than ever.\nRight now, we’re supporting programs to deliver updates in short, two-week increments. Systems get twice-a-month updates, prioritized and delivered through the software development method known as DevSecOps. That way, customers no longer have to wait six months or a year for a fix – glitches get patched and concerns are resolved quickly and continuously.\nOur rapid-delivery model can handle volume and complexity because of an open and flexible software base. It allows the ground control system software to be scalable, whether it’s one satellite in need of an update or a thousand.\nAs customers receive faster updates to their operating systems, they can also take advantage of artificial intelligence and machine learning. For example, low Earth orbit satellites move at 15,000 mph. That doesn’t leave time for human eyes to note changes in an environment or detect something out of the ordinary.\nBut, with AI/ML tools in the mission management software, sensors act as “superhuman eyes.” They can pick up errant signals in a split second, and the system can log and flag the signals for review. The system may not know what the signal is, but it will know it shouldn’t be there, or that it’s new.\nThe next frontier is greater integration of assets. That will help continuity – if an object of interest passes out of one sensor’s range, another sensor, like one on an aircraft, can swoop in and take over.\nSatellites or sensors in use by one service can be harnessed by another to transfer information faster and to save operational costs. Operators can have access to better tactical resources through mission management technology.\nOperationally, these integrated satellite communications can be just as critical to a mission as an F-35 is now. If there’s an intelligence need, any sensor in the specific area of need can be tasked to provide information, and since the system is integrated, the data goes directly to the right user on the ground.\nRaytheon Technologies develops space technologies that are used for purposes as diverse as missile warning and defense, intelligence, weather and climate monitoring, Earth observation, human space flight, and beyond.

Still, it covers enough defense and foreign policy issues to give a good idea of where the new administration intends to head.\nFirst things first: the administration deserves kudos for coming out so early with guidance. With only a skeleton crew of confirmed political appointees the administration has, in just 45 days, produced guidance designed to shape the President’s first budget requests and policy decisions until more formal reviews can be completed.\nSecond, and most encouraging: Seemingly gone is the naivety of the Obama era when the administration\nhoped\nfor “deeper and more effective partnerships” with countries like\nChina\nand\nRussia\n. Biden’s interim guidance rightly\ncalls out\nChina for becoming more “assertive” and identifies Beijing and Moscow as having “invested heavily in efforts meant to check U.S. strengths and prevent us from defending our interests and allies around the world.”\nAreas of continuity with the Trump administration include identification of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran as potential adversaries. Alliances and allies enjoy great importance in the Biden guidance, with its call to “reinvigorate and modernize our alliances and partnerships around the world.” Unfortunately, accompanying that sound guidance are some lingering traces of campaign rhetoric, e.g., “America cannot afford to be absent any longer on the world stage. And under the Biden-Harris Administration, America is back. Diplomacy is back. Alliances are back.” Such political sloganeering seems jarringly out of place in a strategy document.\nThe interim guidance identifies three national priorities: protect the security of the American people; expand economic prosperity and opportunity; and realize and defend the democratic values at the heart of the American way of life. The first two—security and prosperity—nest nearly exactly with the first two pillars of President Trump’s 2017\nNational Security Strategy\nand deserve top billing in any American national security document. Biden’s third priority, defending democratic values, was mentioned in the Trump strategy in a sub-section under “Advance American Influence.” But Biden affords democratic values higher prominence.\nThe third pillar in Trump’s National Security Strategy was “Preserve Peace Through Strength,” acknowledging how a strong military “ensures our diplomats are able to operate from a position of strength.” Biden’s guidance takes great pain to state the administration will make “responsible use of our military,\nwhile elevating diplomacy as our tool of first resort\n[emphasis added].” This, too, comes across as virtue-signaling, as one would be hard-pressed to think of a time when America used its military as a “tool of first resort.”\nIn the relatively short section discussing national defense as traditionally defined, the interim guidance contains some puzzling thoughts regarding nuclear weapons. For example, it states the administration will “head off costly arms races.” Absent is acknowledgment that our two primary nuclear competitors, Russia and China, have already embarked upon—and largely completed—modernizations of their nuclear arsenals, while the U.S. continues to rely on antiquated platforms and aged weapons. Indeed it isn’t out of a desire for an “arms race” that\nthe U.S. is belatedly pursuing nuclear modernization\n; it is now a matter of preserving deterrence itself, and potentially of national survival.\nThe nuclear section goes on to state the U.S. will “reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy.” It seems rather at odds with statements made by\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin\n, who\ntestified\nat his confirmation hearing that nuclear deterrence is “DOD’s highest priority mission.” How can the administration reduce the role of nuclear weapons if it is the DOD’s highest priority mission? Perhaps this refers to backing off some of the new “low-yield” weapons that Trump proposed and Democrats consistently rejected as destabilizing, but with so few details we can only speculate.\nFurther guidance on the military reassuringly identifies investment in people as the highest priority, and that the administration will sustain readiness and “ensure the U.S. Armed Forces remain the best trained and equipped force in the world.”\nUnsurprisingly, the guidance also takes up the increasingly common call for the military to “shift our emphasis from unneeded legacy platforms and weapon systems to free up resources for investments in the cutting-edge technologies....” Missing is any acknowledgement that the legacy platforms proposed for divestment would be essential to defend America from adversaries today, should the need arise. Divesting arms in hand on the mere promise of a future technology is foolhardy.\nAlso carried forward from the Presidential campaign is the mantra that the United States “should not, and will not, engage in ‘forever wars’ that have cost thousands of lives and trillions of dollars.”\nThe U.S. military presence in Afghanistan is performing several functions,\nsuch as advising Afghan forces and conducting counter-terrorism operations, but fighting a “forever war” is not one of them. The term “forever war” should be retired, and the decision to retain a U.S. presence in Afghanistan should be considered on the merits, not a bumper sticker slogan.\nNational security guidance, especially early in an administration, provides useful insight into a president’s vision and views. That it came out so quickly speaks well of the processes in the nascent Biden\nNational Security Council\n.\nThe administration will have the opportunity to refine it when they publish the required full National Security Strategy within a year of the inauguration. Let’s hope that the full strategy will focus more on nuts-and-bolts national security and foreign policy goals and less on other topics, which, fresh off an election, clearly weigh on their minds now.\nThomas Spoehr\n, a retired Army lieutenant general, directs the Heritage Foundation’s Center for National Defense.

The term “forever war” should be retired, and the decision to retain a U.S. presence in Afghanistan should be considered on the merits, not a bumper sticker slogan.</p>\n<p>National security guidance, especially early in an administration, provides useful insight into a president’s vision and views.  That it came out so quickly speaks well of the processes in the nascent Biden <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/national-security-council/\">National Security Council</a>.</p>\n<p>The administration will have the opportunity to refine it when they publish the required full National Security Strategy within a year of the inauguration.

Joe Courtney\n, fired a shot across the bow of\nthe White House shipbuilding budget\n, questioning its proposed cuts to surface warships.\nAn even more prominent Democrat, Senate Armed Services chairman\nJack Reed\n, signaled loud and clear he plans to treat the Biden budget as a rough draft, not gospel. While Reed didn’t cite specific areas of disagreement the way Courtney did, he sounded sympathetic to pleas for higher spending.\n“The President’s Defense Budget Request is an outline and a starting point,” Reed said in a statement late Friday. “Of note, Fiscal Year 2022 is the first in many years that we will not be constrained by the Budget Control Act. Eliminating arbitrary spending caps means every department’s budget can, and should, be argued on its merits.”\n“There must be a bipartisan commitment to truly bringing the power of the purse back to the Congress,” Reed added.\nReed isn’t just blandly asserting congressional prerogatives in general. Congress really does have more leeway to plus up the budget with the demise of the Budget Control Act caps.\nIt’s also worth noting that Reed’s counterpart, House Armed Services chairman\nRep. Adam Smith\n, didn’t put anywhere near as much emphasis on Congress’s power to revise the budget. His statement, also issued late Friday, says mildly, “I look forward to thorough bipartisan hearings and discussions with DoD leadership on the budget request to better understand how the\ninterim National Security Strategic Guidance\nand the Administration’s policies shaped this budget request as we construct this year’s National Defense Authorization Act.” That’s surprisingly deferential to the White House for the often-acerbic Smith.\nIn his statement, Smith largely stuck to praising the Biden plan on a host of points, from its clear strategic focus on China and Russia – “As I’ve said before, the strategy behind how the Department spends the money is much more important than how much money is allocated” – to its divestment of aging weapons.\nIn a surprising move, Reed praised the administration for its plan to scrap older equipment to modernize the force, saying that “the proposed divestments of $2.8 billion of equipment across the services is also well-reasoned.” Members of Congress traditionally oppose the en masse retirement of existing equipment if it affects budgets and jobs in their districts.\nBoth Reed, of Rhode Island, and Courtney, of Connecticut, highlighted the budget’s support for nuclear-powered submarines, which are built in their home states.\n“The proposed reinvestment in essential platforms like the Columbia- and Virginia-class submarines is a prudent decision,” Reed said. The giant boomers will carry nuclear missiles, while the smaller and more numerous Virginias are attack boats.\n“The nearly $12 billion request for submarine construction and development is the largest investment in our undersea fleet since the 1980s,” Courtney enthused Friday. “The shipbuilding budget protects that priority far better than what we saw in the last President’s budget submission in February 2020,” when President Trump tried to cut\nVirginia\nproduction from two a year to one, a cut reversed by a congressional revolt led by Courtney.\nBut, Courtney went on, other aspects of the shipbuilding budget are less satisfactory. “One notable concern is that the budget asks Congress to both authorize the reduction of the aging cruiser fleet, and also decrease the procurement of Flight III destroyers meant to replace the decommissioned cruisers,” he said. “This is an inconsistent policy that will leave the Navy shorthanded of a ship that can perform air warfare command to support our aircraft carriers. In addition, cutting a destroyer will negatively impact a fragile industrial base, which depends on stable and predictable production.”\nThe Navy’s\nTiconderoga\n-class cruisers and\nArleigh Burke\n-class destroyers are also known as Aegis ships, because they’re built around the Aegis air and missile defense system, which allows them to protect supercarriers and other vessels from attack. The Navy has tried on and off for years to retire the aging\nTiconderogas\nbut Congress repeatedly forced them to modernize the ships instead. The\nArleigh Burkes\nare still in production, in the much-ugpgraded Flight III variant, at a rate of two per year – but the Biden budget asks for only one.\nThe Biden plan does add another surface warship, the first\nConstellation\n-class frigate\n. The frigate does have a version of the Aegis system, but it lacks the radar and firepower to perform the same fleet-defense role as the larger destroyers and cruisers. The\nConstellation\nis also being built at Fincantieri Marinette Marine in Wisconsin, not at the traditional destroyer yards in Virginia and the Gulf Coast.\nIt seems likely that Courtney and his seapower committee will push for more surface warships, particularly restoring an Aegis destroyer.

Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON:\nWichita State University\nin Kansas is taking an Army Black Hawk helicopter apart piece by piece, scanning each component to create a detailed three-dimensional model that could be be used for 3D printing, the head of\nAviation & Missile Command\ntold reporters this afternoon.\n“We have a UH-60 Lima [that] we are currently disassembling,” AMCOM chief\nMaj. Gen. Todd Royar\nexplained. “[For each] component, they’re scanning it, making a 3D model of it, putting it in a CAD [Computer-Aided Design] file... We’ll start to get those back in a couple of months.”\nJust how many different components are there in the\nUH-60L model of the Black Hawk\n?\n“We expect to probably get about 20,000 structural parts, -ish, out of that,” Royar said. “We’ll take a look at it and evaluate every one” to see whether it can be safely and economically replaced with a 3D-printed version.\nOther\nbranches of Army Materiel Command\nare conducting even more massive efforts.\nTank-Automotive Command\n(TACOM), which sustains and maintains ground vehicles is assessing about 48,000 parts for their suitability to be 3D-printed.\nCommunications-Electronics Command\n(CECOM) is assessing roughly\n98,000\n.\nCECOM is not quite one-third of the way through, said its commander,\nMaj. Gen. Mitchell Kilgo\n. So far, he said, they’ve evaluated 31 percent of the parts – over 30,000 items – and found 252 that are “potential candidates for additive manufacturing.” That’s less than one percent.\nWhy is this so hard? 3D printers can be made simple enough for schoolkids to use. But if you’re trying to print a part that’ll hold up in battle or in flight, you can’t just eyeball the original and guesstimate the dimensions to enter into the printer. Even a detailed blueprint might not include enough detail to turn the 2D drawing into a 3D model accurate enough for printing.\nNow, companies that use modern digital design techniques produce 3D models of their\nnew\nparts as a matter of course, and they often share these with the government. TACOM has such data files for\nthe new Infantry Squad Vehicle\n, for instance, and plans to 3D print some parts as a proof of concept. But digital models simply don’t exist for vast inventories of older parts, some dating back decades.\nTo make a model where none exists, you need to use a specialized scanner – some are handheld, others mounted on robotic arms – to map each part in three dimensions, creating a CAD file.\nThat’s just one step in a complex process, explained\nBrig. Gen. Darren Werner\n, commander of TACOM, which oversees the Army’s new\nAdvanced Manufacturing Center of Excellence\nat Rock Island Arsenal.\nYou have to study and analyze parts to identify which might be suitable for 3D printing, because not everything is. For example, some components might come under so much stress that they’re best machined from a single, solid block of metal, using traditional “subtractive” manufacturing, instead of additive manufacturing that builds objects up layer by printed layer. They might need to be made of special materials, or specially treated, in ways that 3D printers can’t yet handle. They might be just too big for the available printers to produce: At Rock Island, Werner said, the largest item they can 3D-print is about the size of a hotel mini-fridge. Other parts might be\npossible\nto print but cheaper to make the old-fashioned way – so there’s an economic element of the analysis, not just an engineering one.\nOnce you’ve identified a suitable part, you need to certify that the 3D-printed version will be safe and reliable. That’s one of the most demanding and time-consuming parts of the process, the generals at today’s press conference agreed, especially for aircraft where components must meet Army and FAA flight-safety standards.\n“It’s relatively easy, once you have a 3D model, to print something,” said Royar, who’s the Army’s airworthiness certification authority, “but to ensure that it meets the qualification standards, that’s hard.”\nOnce you’ve certified the part, you can start 3D printing it in bulk – and doing quality control to ensure each individual copy is up to spec. When you print that specific model in that specific printer, does the output meet all the proper tolerances? Does it do so consistently every time? Does a seemingly slight change, like feeding the printer a different batch of powdered metal, cause a significant difference in the final product?\nOnly once you’ve answered all these questions satisfactorily can you issue the printed part to maintenance troops, contractors, and Army depots for use with actual military equipment.\nDespite all these hurdles,\nall the armed\nservices\n, not just the Army, see tremendous potential in 3D printing that makes it worth this effort. The military holds onto equipment for decades, long after the production line has shut down, in many cases after the original manufacturer and their suppliers have gone out of business, so there’s no one out there who\ncan\nmake a particular part: The Army would have to fund someone to recreate the tooling and techniques. In other cases, a part may be absolutely critical to a weapons system working, but only a handful need replacement every year, so the profit margin for industry to make and sell them the traditional way would be too slim.\nIn the scenario that has military logisticians most excited, a unit in combat, its supply lines under attack or cut off altogether, could potentially 3D-print its own repair parts on demand. Instead of transporting an\n“iron mountain\n” of different spares, not knowing which ones the unit will actually need, it could deploy with an archive of 3D models, a few printers, and a supply of powdered feedstock for printing.

{"title": "JROC Tags Space Force To Make Satellites Link With JADC2", "publish_time": "2021-06-03 17:38:02", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: The Space Force will be the integrator for all joint space requirements — starting with a satellite backbone for\nJoint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2)\n, service vice chief Gen. DT Thompson says.\nThe\nJoint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)\nmade the decision, Thompson told the MilSatCom symposium today.\n“They’ve just completed the process of identifying the Space Force officially and formally as the integrator for all joint space requirements,” he said “That shouldn’t be a surprise to any of you — and you can understand in many cases how broad that is.” But it is now official.\nThe move was prompted by the JROC’s work on both the\nJoint Warfighting Concept (JWC)\nto define future all domain operations in a global war against peer adversaries, and the related\nJADC2 strategy\nto flesh out a C2 network structure and related capabilities to underpin that concept. Both are expected to be publicly released any day now.\n“The impetus for that designation, and the first new order of business for them, is related to data transport, data relay communications through space to enable Joint All Domain Command and Control,” Thompson said. The decision has already kick-started “the demand signal from the requirements perspective” for a JADC2 comms backbone the Space Force will need to create.\nThe new\nSpace Warfighting Analysis Center (SWAC)\nwill take the lead in figuring out how to do that, he explained.\n“Later this fall, our Space Warfighting Analysis Center will begin a force design initiative specifically focused on data relay/transport communications in space,” Thompson said. This will be a “huge, complex and vital undertaking,” he added, that will require breaking down current stovepipes between traditional satellite communications and Internet-enabled data routing to provide services across a wide variety of radio frequencies and existing military command, control and communications (C3) networks.\nThe JROC already has laid down the law that\nall future C2/C3 networks will be based on open data standards\nas\nthey\ndefine them, not the individual services. Further, the Joint Staff J6, responsible for C2 and cyber issues,\nhas instituted a new series of “data summits”\nto continue to sort out the software standards required in future to make JADC2 work.\nOne big question for the Space Force, however, will be how to square this new JROC-blessed responsibility with the fact that it is not in charge of building the JADC2 satellite backbone. That is instead,\nby decree of the previous Defense Secretary Mark Esper\n, being done by the\nSpace Development Agency (SDA).\nSDA is an independent Pentagon agency under DoD’s Research & Engineering office, and Director Derek Tournear has authority to make his own decisions about the data link standards SDA intends to use to connect the satellites in its\nNational Defense Space Architecture\nand in downlink data to terrestrial users across the Joint Force.\nUnder a planned reorganization of the Space Force\n, the goal is to switch SDA’s status to a semi-independent body reporting for directly to Chief of Space Operations Gen. Jay Raymond on Oct. 1, 2022 — as mandated by Congress — as part of his responsibility to organize, train and equip the new Guardians. But Raymond, as a service chief, does not have acquisition authority. Congress has mandated creation of a\na new, independent space acquisition czar\nand both SDA and Space Force acquisition will be the responsibility of that person.

The decision has already kick-started “the demand signal from the requirements perspective” for a JADC2 comms backbone the Space Force will need to create.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/space-warfighting-analysis-center-swac/\">Space Warfighting Analysis Center (SWAC)</a> will take the lead in figuring out how to do that, he explained.</p>\n<p>“Later this fall, our Space Warfighting Analysis Center will begin a force design initiative specifically focused on data relay/transport communications in space,” Thompson said. This will be a “huge, complex and vital undertaking,” he added, that will require breaking down current stovepipes between traditional satellite communications and Internet-enabled data routing to provide services across a wide variety of radio frequencies and existing military command, control and communications (C3) networks.</p>\n<p>The JROC already has laid down the law that <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/05/hyten-joint-requirements-for-all-domain-out-by-june/\">all future C2/C3 networks will be based on open data standards</a> as <em>they</em> define them, not the individual services. Further, the Joint Staff J6, responsible for C2 and cyber issues, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/01/exclusive-do-or-die-jadc2-summit-to-crunch-common-data-standards/\">has instituted a new series of “data summits”</a> to continue to sort out the software standards required in future to make JADC2 work.</p>\n<p>One big question for the Space Force, however, will be how to square this new JROC-blessed responsibility with the fact that it is not in charge of building the JADC2 satellite backbone. That is instead, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/theater-commands-ok-sdas-sat-plans-exclusive/\">by decree of the previous Defense Secretary Mark Esper</a>, being done by the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/space-development-agency/\">Space Development Agency (SDA). </a>SDA is an independent Pentagon agency under DoD’s Research & Engineering office, and Director Derek Tournear has authority to make his own decisions about the data link standards SDA intends to use to connect the satellites in its <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/national-defense-space-architecture/\">National Defense Space Architecture</a> and in downlink data to terrestrial users across the Joint Force.</p>\n<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/smc-revamp-sidesteps-hills-space-acquisition-worries/\">Under a planned reorganization of the Space Force</a>, the goal is to switch SDA’s status to a semi-independent body reporting for directly to Chief of Space Operations Gen. Jay Raymond on Oct. 1, 2022 — as mandated by Congress — as part of his responsibility to organize, train and equip the new Guardians. But Raymond, as a service chief, does not have acquisition authority.

But they also raised are a number of macro economic and geopolitical trends in motion, which the US needs to begin to address or risk deleterious affects on national security.\nAdministration Support\nWhile no one expects the Space Force to be undone, experts say that, at a fundamental level, the incoming Biden administration will need to take stock of whether leaders are comfortable with the re-orientation of military space efforts toward a stronger focus on warfighting in space.\nTodd Harrison, director of the Aerospace Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told me in an email that the Space Force will need to work on “getting the attention and buy-in of the Biden team.” He explained that “some of the people who are likely to take senior civilian roles in the Pentagon are folks who were against creating the Space Force, and may still need to be convinced about why it is needed.” One factor to look for will be “whether the new administration keeps the National Space Council and who chairs it.”\n“I will be very curious to see how the Space Force shakes out in the next year or so. It’s not going away but how it manifests itself could be different,” Victoria Samson, Washington Office director for Secure World Foundation, said in an email. As one example, she said, “I’ll be watching the\nrhetoric over cislunar space\nvis-a-vis China.”\nRetired Air Force Gen. Hawk Carlisle, head of the National Defense Industrial Association, said that one key task will be decisions about how DoD prioritizes resources to address the “congested, contested and competitive” space environment (a phrase coined by the Obama-era Pentagon.) “How do we transition from what we built, based on that benign environment, to what’s next, and how do we continue to resource a brand new service so that it can accomplish the mission? How this new administration resources, how it looks at where we’re going with this US Space Force — and US Space Command for that matter — that’s going to be incredibly important,” he said.\nBrian Weeden, director of program planning at Secure World Foundation, said that presumptive Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his team will need to make decisions about funding the long-touted need for space system resiliency. “I think it’s mentioned every 5 words in the national security section of the\nnew [National Space Policy]\nand also featured in the Defense Space Strategy that came out a few months ago,” he said. “Again, the big question is ‘will there be any actual follow-through, particularly in changes to national security space architectures’?”\nHarrison noted that an indicator will be “how the new administration approaches the Space Development Agency in terms of moving it to the Space Force and the pLEO programs it is currently pursuing.” Proliferated LEO, or pLEO, is short-hand for the use of large constellations of small satellites in Low Earth Orbit (below 2000 kilometers in altitude) as alternatives, or back-ups, to current military space systems comprising small numbers of large, and expensive, satellites in higher orbits.\nSpace Force’s Organization\nWhile the Pentagon has done an enormous amount of work on standing up Space Force since its Dec. 20, 2019 inception, the new service remains in its infancy. Thus, scores of organizational issues need resolution over the next year. “This first year was all about inventing that service. This next year is all about integrating the Space Force more broadly,”\nChief of Space Operations Gen. Jay Raymond said in a Dec. 15 briefing\nwith reporters.\nFor example, CSIS’s Kaitlyn Johnson said she will be keeping a close eye on “the space acquisition piece.”\nAs\nBreaking D\nreaders know, Air Force, DoD and the White House have yet to agree on a plan for reorganization of\nspace acquisition authorities\n— much to the concern of Congress, which has demanded an independent Space Force acquisition executive. A\nproposal on a new organization was due to Congress this past March,\nbut has been delayed by internal administration squabbling.\n“Will they ever resubmit that report?” Johnson asked. “Will Congress acquiesce to less oversight?”\nJamie Morin, vice president of defense systems operations at the Aerospace Corporation’s Defense Systems Group, noted in an interview that the Space Force also is going to have to figure out how much risk it actually is willing to take in order to speed space acquisition cycles.\n“There’s been a lot of talk about a need for dramatic acceleration in cycle time to deal with the competitive space environment on the national security side. And some of the goals that have been set out have been very, very ambitious,” he said. “They’re the sort of time goals you could only achieve\nif\nyou are willing to buy fundamentally different things — meaning less complex things. And you’re willing to buy those different things using different processes.”\nExpanding the Space Force’s cadre of personnel (now known, to some hilarity in the Twitter-sphere, as “Guardians”) to include representatives from services other than the Air Force and establishing an independent culture also will require action next year, experts say.\n“Making sure the space components of the other services (the organizations, people, and budgets) are transferred to the Space Force” is critical, Harrison said. “The nation cannot afford the redundancy and confusion created by leaving space forces in the other services. It is one thing to have space experts who can interface with the Space Force, but not space programs and space operators.”\n“We’ve never fought an actual war in space,” Robin Dickey, space policy and strategy analyst at Aerospace’s Center for Space Policy and Strategy, told me in an interview. “We don’t actually know what conflict in space will look like, but you can also be pretty confident that from a warfighting perspective, the typical Space Force Guardian is going to be doing some pretty different activities from the typical army infantry men.” The trick to establishing a unique Space Force culture will be balancing that warfighter identity with that of being a space operator. “And those two are not things that have ever been truly explored and combined before.”\nNorms & Arms Control\nLooming above all the specific questions about the Space Force itself is the foundational question of how does the United States, or at least the Biden administration, best ensure against conflict that could eviscerate the economic and societal benefits provided by access to space? Key to doing so, experts across the political spectrum say, will be decisions the US makes next year about its role in setting\ninternational\nnorms of behavior\nfor space operators — both in peacetime and wartime.\nMorin said the US has to get real about setting norms and rules on issues ranging from\nspace traffic management\nin a much more crowded and “democratized” space environment, to\ndebris mitigation/removal,\nto access to the radio frequency spectrum. DoD must also choose wisely about which commercial activities it invests in — and ensure that if fully understands the potential vulnerabilities and consequences.\n“From a national security perspective, I think all of that can construct sort of a background environment … potential things that could go wrong that could be perceived as for runners to conflict,” he said. “If the big question in crowded and democratized space, in light of the contested nature of the spaces domain, is how do we, United States and other nations, conduct ourselves such that we avoid having a war — and, such that if we end up in a war, we avoid having that war extend to space — if that’s the big geopolitical question of this era, I think we actually have some significant choices we’re making in just the next year or so that are going to establish or not establish key norms … in ways that are either stabilizing or not.\n“If we are all on edge watching for harmful interference or kinetic attacks on satellites and we have a way more crowded environment, we’re increasing the chance — in some cases geometrically — of those things of accidental things being perceived as intentional,” he explained.\nRick Ambrose, Lockheed Martin Space executive vice president, said in an email that “space sustainability will grow in importance” over the next year. “We want a future where all of humanity can use space for peaceful purposes and socioeconomic benefits, but orbits are becoming overcrowded. Space sustainability needs to be addressed now through adaptive policies and encouraging new technologies.” This will require the US and other governments to “continue establishing cooperative policies to manage space traffic and reduce the risk of satellite collisions and interference,” including forcing companies to include “post-mission disposal plans in satellite design from the start, or there will be an unmanageable amount of space debris that could be catastrophic to the systems we rely on every day.”\nDickey said one thing “most immediately relevant” is for the US to define “what is reckless or aggressive or hostile behavior in space. … What the United States national security community says and does about space will be a major step towards defining what is acceptable and not acceptable” including at the international level.\nBrian Weeden agreed that normative issues are now at the forefront of space security. But despite the Trump administration’s call for the US to take a lead in norm setting, he said, “the question of whether or not the US will actually propose any norms” remains up in the air.\nEmbedded in the discussion of norms, Johnson stressed, is the “worrying, growing trend of normalization of direct-ascent ASAT tests and other counterspace technologies like jamming and spoofing.”\nLikewise, Jessica West, of Canada’s Project Ploughshares, said that not just norms but actual arms control will be a big issue for 2021. “The UK initiative on norms of behaviour in the United Nations seeks to restart a long-stalled conversation on space security, but I think that there will be additional pressure to think more seriously about arms control, particularly because the United States is persistently publicizing what it views as weapons tests by Russia,” she said in an email. “The question is, whether 2021 will mark a year of engagement and attempts at convergence, or continued divergence and dithering.”\nFinally, norm setting comes to play not just\nin\nspace, but also in what the US uses space for to achieve on Earth, suggests Robbie Shingler, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Planet. Addressing climate change is one example where the US can make decisions that can shift behavior.\n“Climate change is the challenge of our generation, and a significant national security issue,” he said. “As sustainability and climate action become increasingly important elements of corporate strategy and governance, we expect to see concerted efforts to combine federal Earth imaging systems with commercial datasets to better measure, record, coordinate, and disseminate climate change data across government, research institutions, and state and local governments. This whole of government approach to addressing climate change with commercial remote sensing data will enable agencies, communities, and individuals to make better decisions.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The past year was such a momentous year in national security space, it’s hard to put a lasso around all the policy, political, bureaucratic and technical issues facing US decision-makers next year.</p>\n<p>In a totally unscientific poll (comprising people we could reach before the holiday lull), analysts and industry experts raised a handful of critical questions regarding <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/12/white-house-unveils-new-space-policy-but-does-it-matter/\">the service’s maturation under a new administration</a> likely to be less, well, <em>focused</em> on space in general.

{"title": "DARPA’s Hypersonic OpFires Aims For Army 1,000-Mile Missile", "publish_time": "2020-10-23 11:01:58", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: The Army has not yet said which\noff-the-shelf missile\nit will modify to field a thousand-mile\nMid-Range Capability in 2023\n— but DARPA is already working on a replacement.\nDARPA is developing a new intermediate-range weapon it calls\nOperational Fires\n, a reference to the theater level of war, between tactics and strategy. This year, DARPA is ground-testing three rival designs for a revolutionary “throttleable” rocket motor, with the winner going on to a full-up flight test in 2023. By that point, according to\nthe current modernization plan\n, the Army will already have started buying an off-the-shelf MRC missile to meet immediate needs – but DARPA will have to convince the service that OpFires is the long-term solution it really wants.\nWill the Army Want OpFires?\nOpFires began 2017 as a joint Army-DARPA effort to develop a hypersonic weapon with a range between\n500 and 5,500 kilometers\n(310 to 3,418 miles). That’s because\nthe INF Treaty – later abrogated\n– banned cruise and ballistic missiles in that range band but (arguably) not hypersonics, which are neither. The Army\nprovided $19 million for OpFires in 2020 and requested another $28 million for 2021\n– but the service then decided to\npull its funding\n.\nNevertheless, DARPA and prime contractor Lockheed Martin are still optimistic that what they’re building could be the Army’s long-term answer for its mid-range missile needs, and the service still gets regular briefings on OpFires’s progress. While the DARPA missile won’t be ready for fielding in 2023, it could “absolutely” lead to an operational Army weapon in the “later 2020s,” said DARPA’s program manager, Army Lt. Col.\nAmber Walker\n.\n“We’re well-suited from a system development standpoint to catch them on the back end, [and] we are uniquely aligned to the Army’s medium-range gap,” Walker said in an interview. While the decision is up to the Army, she told me, “we certainly hope ... it’ll be at least a compelling option for them to consider.”\nWhat would OpFires offer the Army it can’t get otherwise? It’s important that it’s both intermediate-range and hypersonic. In 2023, the Army plans to deploy both its first hypersonic missile, the\nLong-Range Hypersonic Weapon\n(LRHW), and its first intermediate-range missile since the Cold War Pershing III, the\nMid-Range Capability\n(MRC). But it won’t have a weapon that’s both intermediate-range\nand\nhypersonic.\nLRHW will be bigger, faster, and longer-ranged than MRC, flying “thousands of kilometers” as opposed to 1,800 km (1,118 miles). LRHW will also be much more expensive and relatively rare,\nreserved for the most important, distant, and difficult targets\n.\nBut just this year, the Army decided it needed MRC as well as a cheaper, more numerous weapon to strike larger numbers of less distant targets. That late start meant the Army couldn’t develop a new weapon by 2023, so it would need to modify a US or allied missile already in service – and none of those is hypersonic.\nHaving a smaller, cheaper hypersonic option alongside LRHW would be intriguing for Army commanders. “We view ourselves as complementary [to LRHW] and not duplicative,” Walker emphasized.\nSignificantly, Lockheed Martin has already selected the\nhypersonic glide body\nthat will carry the missile warhead, coasting to the target (hence “glide body”) at Mach 5-plus once the rocket motors cut off. That glide body is the one Lockheed is already developing for\nthe Air Force’s ARRW program (Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon)\n. While the exact sizes of these weapons are classified, both DARPA and Lockheed Martin confirmed for me that the ARRW glide body is smaller than LRHW’s. That would allow the whole weapon to be smaller, which would make it cost less, too.\nWhy OpFires Would Be Revolutionary\nOpFires isn’t just about building a smaller, cheaper hypersonic missile. If it were, DARPA wouldn’t bother, since the agency’s whole mission is high-risk, high-reward R&D. The “DARPA hard” part of the OpFires program is developing a revolutionary technology known as a “throttleable” rocket motor: In layman’s terms, a rocket that you can turn off at will, instead of having to wait until it burns through all its fuel.\nYou see, modern solid-fuel rocket motors have basically one setting: ALL AHEAD FULL. Once they’ve started burning and emitting thrust, you can’t turn them down or turn them off. (\nLiquid-fuel rockets\ndon’t have this issue, but they pose other major problems in a military application). As a result, a solid-fuel rocket has trouble hitting targets that are significantly closer than its maximum range. You\ncan\nmake a long-range rocket hit a short-range target, but if you make it dive back towards the ground a lot earlier than it’s designed to do, that\nputs tremendous stress on the weapon\n, which could make it miss or even break apart in flight. That’s especially true for a rocket powerful enough to get the warhead moving at hypersonic speeds.\nSimply put, Walker told me, “if you give it a lot of energy, it’s going to go far, and it’s actually really hard to make it go less far... without actually breaking it in the process.”\nSo instead of having a rocket motor you have to fight to rein in, you want a rocket motor you can just\nturn off\nwhen you’ve reached your target – a throttleable rocket. But that’s not easy either. For reasons of safety and reliability, solid rocket fuel is carefully formulated so it doesn’t either start\nor\nstop burning by accident, and historically no one tried to make it stop burning in mid-flight\non purpose.\n“Rocket motors are built to burn, and in this case, we’re trying to stop it when we want to,” Walker told me, “and, oh, by the way, also make it temperature-insensitive and safe for transport.” Army missiles in particular have to endure all sorts of conditions, from Arctic cold to desert heat to swampy humidity, and still fire reliably on command – and\nonly\nwhen commanded to.\nSo in 2018, after a year of studies and consultation with the Army, DARPA contracted with three companies to develop throttleable rockets:\nAerojet\n,\nExquadrum\n, and\nSierra Nevada Corporation\n(SNC). All three\nsuccessfully demonstrated\nminiature versions of the motor and got further awards to build and ground-test a full-scale version. Exquadrum has\ncompleted\nthat ground test, while Aerojet and SNC hope to do theirs before the end of the year. It’ll be up to Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor, to pick which of the three designs to use for the actual missile to be flight-tested in 2023.\nA further wrinkle: The throttleable rocket motor will be the\nsecond\nstage of the OpFires rocket booster. The first stage launches the weapon and boosts it through the thickest part of the atmosphere, which requires different performance characteristics; it will be tested separately in November or December of next year.\nSince the throttleable rocket motor is so tricky, DARPA and Lockheed Martin are trying to keep the rest of OpFires as simple as possible. Besides borrowing the\nARRW\nprogram’s glide body, it’ll use the existing Army fire control system,\nAFATDS.\nIt will require no new specialized support equipment; and its launcher will fit on the back of a common Army cargo truck, the 10-wheeler\nPalletized Load System\n(PLS). The weapon will fire from the back of the PLS in both the 2021 first-stage-only test and the 2023 full-up flight test.\nWhat happens after that? TBD, Walker told me. DARPA’s job is to prove new technologies work, not to field them as integrated, combat-ready weapons systems: That’s the armed services’ job.\n“A plan beyond 23? I can’t say that I have one today, but that’s clearly what we’re working to over the next year or two,” Walker told me. “In the ideal world, a service picks that up.”\nThe Navy might just be interested in OpFires as a lower-cost alternative to\nits own version of the long-range hypersonic weapon\nnow that the White House wants\nto place hypersonics on all US destroyers\n. But DARPA’s big bet is on the Army.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The Army has not yet said which <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/10/army-asks-hill-for-new-mid-range-missile-asap-thurgood/\">off-the-shelf missile</a> it will modify to field a thousand-mile <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/09/army-seeks-new-mid-range-missile-prototype-by-2023/\">Mid-Range Capability in 2023</a> — but DARPA is already working on a replacement.</p>\n<p>DARPA is developing a new intermediate-range weapon it calls <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/program/operational-fires\">Operational Fires</a>, a reference to the theater level of war, between tactics and strategy.

{"title": "Why Those 780 Top National Security Leaders Support Biden", "publish_time": "2020-10-30 18:12:20", "author": ["James Kitfield"], "content": "Speaking publicly and in alarming terms about a partisan political issue does not come naturally to retired generals and former senior national security leaders. These public servants, many of them wartime commanders and leaders, are not given to histrionics or hyperbole.\nSo w\nhen hundreds (it’s now up to 780) of national security leaders\n– including 22 retired four-star general officers and five former Defense Secretaries who’ve served in both Republican and Democratic administrations — put their names on a public letter supporting former Vice P\nresident Joe Biden’s run for the White House, Breaking Defense contributor James Kitfield interviewed a cross section of them to find out why.\n“All of us who spent careers in the military were raised on the notion that you lead by example, and President Trump has been the antithesis of that in dealing with this pandemic,” said Charles “Steve” Abbot, former commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet and deputy Homeland Security Adviser. “Instead of taking steps that I would call ‘Crisis Management 101,’ President Trump shirked his duty to the nation by failing to provide the central leadership necessary to get our arms around the problem, and he continues to mislead the entire nation about this terrible threat. The result of that failure of leadership was that his administration committed an unrelenting string of missteps, and the American public has lost trust in what the president tells them.”\nThe final straw for Abbot was President Trump’s attack on mail-in balloting\nduring a general election beset by a pandemic,\ninsisting without evidence that it will lead to “the most rigged election in history.” That sustained attack on the legitimacy of a presidential election could all but portend a constitutional crisis in a close contest.\n“If you want to know why hundreds of us who devoted our lives to service signed a letter saying we feared for our country, look no further than the spectacle of a commander-in-chief threatening not to support a peaceful transition of power if one is required. That’s an effort to undermine our democracy,” Abbot said in an interview. “So, as a Navy man, I would tell you that the ship of state had already taken on a bad list during this pandemic. And President Trump’s insistence that he may not accept the results of the election is a torpedo in the water.”\nThe signatories criticisms fall into some broad categories:\nBelittling And Bullying Allies\nPresident Trump’s America First foreign policy does not mesh with the worldview of most senior military and national security leaders. Trump is strictly transactional on the matter of burden-sharing and other issues related to our allies, and he has repeatedly expressed a view of alliances as little more than protection rackets. He also frequently goes out of his way to belittle and bully venerable allies, variously calling the Canadian prime minister “dishonest” and “weak,” Germany’s chancellor “stupid,” and the French prime minister “very, very nasty.”\n“President Trump has no understanding or interest in the important work of keeping our alliances strong, or nurturing democratic partners and values around the world, because for him it’s all about power and projecting himself,” former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, a Vietnam War veteran and former Republican senator from Nebraska, said. “\nBy treating our allies like a schoolyard bully\nfor the past four years Trump has managed to isolate America. That’s one of many ‘firsts’ authored by Mr. Trump, and as he continues to zoom past all these boundaries and norms you have to worry about what would happen if he gets another four years.”\nPresident Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton said earlier this year that Trump had repeatedly raised the issue of withdrawing the United States from NATO, and warned of “a very real risk” that Trump would actually follow through in a second term.\nNicholas Burns, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO and the number three official at the State Department, put it this way: “Every modern president since Harry Truman has viewed our commitment to democratic allies around the world as sacrosanct, because for half a century those alliances have been a key source of American power.” He noted that a dissolution of NATO is at the top of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s wish list. “Under President Trump we have walked away from that global leadership, and, as a result, trust in the United States has plummeted even among our closest friends. That’s done enormous damage.”\nCoddling Dictators\nTrump’s inexplicably chummy relationships with dictators and despots demonstrated by his “love letters” to North Korean despot Kim Jong Un; his telling Chinese leader-for-life Xi Jinping that he approved of China’s imprisonment of more than one million Uighur Muslims in “reeducation camps”; and his seeming inability to criticize a leader — Vladimir Putin — who has ordered the use of illegal chemical weapons against opponents, murdered them, interfered in U.S. elections and reportedly even put bounties on the heads of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\nAnthony Zinni was the former commander of Central Command. “I never endorsed a presidential candidate in my life, nor do I consider myself a Democrat or a Republican, but Trump’s unwillingness to say anything critical of Putin or even raise the issue of intelligence suggesting that his government has put bounties on the heads of U.S. service members in Afghanistan was more than I could take,” he said in an interview. “I have a son who has served multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, and President Trump didn’t even want to make it an issue? I also have a lot of friends overseas in the allied military and diplomatic communities, and they don’t understand why Trump is pushing away our friends and befriending our adversaries. For us military types who always want friends on our left and right, it doesn’t make any sense.”\nIn his recent book “Rage,” investigative reporter Bob Woodward reports that Trump’s former DNI Dan Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana, remains convinced that Putin has compromising information and leverage over Trump, though he lacked the intelligence to prove it. “How else to explain the president’s behavior?” Woodward writes. “Coats could see no other explanation.”\nMichael Hayden served as director of both the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Intelligence Agency (NSA). He recalls watching the infamous 2018 Helsinki Summit meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin, when the president publicly accepted Putin’s denial of election interference over the repeated conclusions of his own Intelligence Community. In August the Intelligence Community’s top election security official told Congress that\nRussia is once again targeting Trump’s political opposition\nin this election cycle.\n“I watched President Trump’s Helsinki performance, when he said he didn’t ‘see any reason why’ Russia would have interfered in the 2016 election,’ and all I could say was ‘Oh my God!’ It was so awful, said Hayden. “When I talk with agency officials today, they tell me it’s impossible to break through the Fox News narrative that Trump relies on instead of his intelligence briefers. So we’ve dug a very deep hole under four years of Trump’s leadership. After four more years I fear that the America I know and served may not survive.”\nCorrupting Institutions\nThe effects of nearly four years of Trump’s efforts to politicize nonpartisan institutions of the federal government and bend them to his personal agenda have been on stark display. Trump recently publicly pressured Attorney General William Barr to indict presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son in connection with allegations no one has been able to verify. The president and his advisers have reportedly discussed firing FBI Director Chris Wray after Election Day for failing to act on the president’s call. After Trump recently publicly called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to release more of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails in hopes of engineering another “October surprise,” Pompeo agreed. Just ahead of the first presidential debate,\nDirector of National Intelligence\nJohn Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist who had sparse experience with intelligence matters before his nomination, selectively declassified unconfirmed intelligence suggesting that in 2016 it was the Clinton campaign that tried to tie Trump to Russia’s election interference. Some intelligence analysts believe that narrative is part of Russia’s disinformation campaign.\n“Attorney General Barr has been co-opted as the president’s personal lawyer. The Intelligence Community has been so grossly politicized that intelligence briefers withhold any negative intelligence on [Russian President] Vladimir Putin because the president doesn’t want to hear it, and Trump continues to try and corrupt virtually every government institution that has kept our democracy strong and free,” said William Cohen, a former Defense Secretary and Republican senator from Maine. “And the fact that President Trump now feels so unbound as to publicly pressure the attorney general to arrest his political opponents and critics, essentially one upping Richard Nixon’s enemies list, should send shudders through us all.”\nBy now the White House playbook for politicizing and bringing independent institutions and agencies to heel is familiar. Shuffle the leadership until a compliant loyalist emerges; hollow out the bureaucracy by leaving positions in the second and third leadership tiers unfilled; rely on “acting” officials who often are unfamiliar with the place they are working and its topics so they can be more easily controlled and fired, thus circumventing the Senate’s constitutional role of “advise and consent”; and replace or simply fire independent watchdogs like Inspector Generals. Since May, Trump has removed or replaced five Inspector Generals, including watchdogs at the Departments of Defense, State, Transportation, Health and Human Services and in the Intelligence Community.\n“Donald Trump is the first president in our history who has sought to undermine every institution that promotes American values and democratic practices, from our judicial and voting systems, to Congress and the press, to our military and Intelligence Community. None has escaped his assault,” said retired Ambassador Robert Blackwill, former deputy National Security Advisor in the George W. Bush administration. “Personally it never occurred to me early on that President Trump would launch an all-out attack on our democratic institutions and processes, so my imagination failed me on that score. I’ve come to actually believe that he’s not a democrat with a small `d.’ I think his instincts are authoritarian.”\nJanet Napolitano is a former Secretary of Homeland Security. “Whole subcabinets at some government agencies and departments that are supposed to be Senate confirmed are now filled by ‘acting’ officials, and the instability and lack of quality people at the leadership level has done tremendous damage to our institutions,” she said in an interview. As the head of the Department of Homeland Security, Napolitano said she could never imagine the department being involved in the separation of immigrant children from their parents at the southern border, or the recent deployment of Customs and Border Protection paramilitary units to Portland, Oregon to crackdown on violent protests there, over the objections of state and local officials.\n“What we’ve seen is that President Trump is very good at tearing down institutions, but not so good at building them up,” said Napolitano.\nDespite its status by statutory law and tradition as one of the most nonpartisan institutions in the federal government, the Defense Department has not escaped the commander-in-chief’s efforts to enlist it for his political agenda. That became clear last June during Black Lives Matter protests against the killing in police custody of George Floyd. After proclaiming himself “your president of law and order” in a Rose Garden speech, Trump threatened to invoke the rarely-used Insurrection Act to send active-duty troops to “dominate” the streets of America. He then had National Guard troops and federal law enforcement violently disperse mostly peaceful protesters near Lafayette Square so that he could have a photo-op holding up a Bible at a nearby church. Flanking him that day as he strode across Lafayette Square were Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Mark Milley. Both later apologized for their presence at the square.\n“That whole incident around Lafayette Park was stunning to me, because those were mostly peaceful demonstrators exercising a right guaranteed by the Constitution that I’ve sworn allegiance to throughout my entire career,” said retired Gen. Peter Chiarelli, former Vice Chief of the Army. “This president has assaulted the military justice system on behalf of individuals charged with war crimes. He has ended the career of service members like [impeachment witness Lt. Col. Alexander] Vindman for doing his duty and what was right. He has maligned mail-in voting as a fraud and suggested that he might claim victory in a close election before all the ballots are counted, when as a service member I have voted absentee by mail my entire life. So like everyone else I’ve become numb after four years of this, but we have gone places in that time that I never dreamt we would go as a nation. I really do fear that the republic that I swore allegiance to is now under threat.”\nPandemic Mismanagement\nFor many of the retired flag-officers and senior national security leaders who signed the “Open Letter to America,” the president’s leadership during the coronavirus crisis was the final affront. Confronted with a global pandemic and knowing early on that Covid-19 was an especially deadly and contagious virus, Trump nevertheless told the American public that the virus would disappear “like a miracle” when the weather turned warm, with or without a vaccine; that “anybody that wants a test can get a test”; that if the nation simply stopped testing for the virus “we would have very few cases”: that injecting powerful cleaning agents like bleach might cure the virus; that Covid-19 “affects virtually nobody” younger than 18. Meanwhile, with just 4 percent of the world’s population, the United States has 25 percent of the known infections, and at 230,000 plus lives lost the highest death toll by far of any nation.\nAfter hosting what infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci called a “super spreader” event at the White House on September 26, where many participants refused to wear face masks and social distance, President Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, several senior advisers and an estimated 25 other officials tested positive for the virus. One of the attendees was Adm. Charles Ray, second in command of the Coast Guard, who later attended a senior-level meeting at the Pentagon and then tested positive for the virus, forcing the Joint Chiefs of Staff to go into quarantine.\nJames Kitfield, the only three-time winner of the prestigious Gerald R. Ford Award for Distinguished Reporting on National Defense, regularly contributes to Breaking Defense.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<em>Speaking publicly and in alarming terms about a partisan political issue does not come naturally to retired generals and former senior national security leaders. These public servants, many of them wartime commanders and leaders, are not given to histrionics or hyperbole. So w<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/09/no-to-trump-former-vcjcs-selva-488-other-former-top-natsec-leaders/\">hen hundreds (it’s now up to 780)  of national security leaders</a> – including 22 retired four-star general officers and five former Defense Secretaries who’ve served in both Republican and Democratic administrations — put their names on a public letter supporting former Vice President Joe Biden’s run for the White House, Breaking Defense contributor James Kitfield interviewed a cross section of them to find out why.</em>\n<p>“All of us who spent careers in the military were raised on the notion that you lead by example, and President Trump has been the antithesis of that in dealing with this pandemic,” said Charles “Steve” Abbot, former commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet and deputy Homeland Security Adviser. “Instead of taking steps that I would call ‘Crisis Management 101,’ President Trump shirked his duty to the nation by failing to provide the central leadership necessary to get our arms around the problem, and he continues to mislead the entire nation about this terrible threat. The result of that failure of leadership was that his administration committed an unrelenting string of missteps, and the American public has lost trust in what the president tells them.”</p>\n<p>The final straw for Abbot was President Trump’s attack on mail-in balloting <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/2020-election/\">during a general election beset by a pandemic,</a> insisting without evidence that it will lead to “the most rigged election in history.” That sustained attack on the legitimacy of a presidential election could all but portend a constitutional crisis in a close contest.</p>\n\n<p>“If you want to know why hundreds of us who devoted our lives to service signed a letter saying we feared for our country, look no further than the spectacle of a commander-in-chief threatening not to support a peaceful transition of power if one is required. That’s an effort to undermine our democracy,” Abbot said in an interview. “So, as a Navy man, I would tell you that the ship of state had already taken on a bad list during this pandemic. And President Trump’s insistence that he may not accept the results of the election is a torpedo in the water.”</p>\n<p>The signatories criticisms fall into some broad categories:</p>\n\n<b>Belittling And Bullying Allies</b>\n<p>President Trump’s America First foreign policy does not mesh with the worldview of most senior military and national security leaders. Trump is strictly transactional on the matter of burden-sharing and other issues related to our allies, and he has repeatedly expressed a view of alliances as little more than protection rackets. He also frequently goes out of his way to belittle and bully venerable allies, variously calling the Canadian prime minister “dishonest” and “weak,” Germany’s chancellor “stupid,” and the French prime minister “very, very nasty.”</p>\n\n \n<p>“President Trump has no understanding or interest in the important work of keeping our alliances strong, or nurturing democratic partners and values around the world, because for him it’s all about power and projecting himself,” former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, a Vietnam War veteran and former Republican senator from Nebraska, said. “<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/category/allies/\">By treating our allies like a schoolyard bully</a> for the past four years Trump has managed to isolate America. That’s one of many ‘firsts’ authored by Mr. Trump, and as he continues to zoom past all these boundaries and norms you have to worry about what would happen if he gets another four years.”</p>\n<p>President Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton said earlier this year that Trump had repeatedly raised the issue of withdrawing the United States from NATO, and warned of “a very real risk” that Trump would actually follow through in a second term.</p>\n<p>Nicholas Burns, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO and the number three official at the State Department, put it this way: “Every modern president since Harry Truman has viewed our commitment to democratic allies around the world as sacrosanct, because for half a century those alliances have been a key source of American power.” He noted that a dissolution of NATO is at the top of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s wish list. “Under President Trump we have walked away from that global leadership, and, as a result, trust in the United States has plummeted even among our closest friends. That’s done enormous damage.”</p>\n<b>Coddling Dictators</b>\n<p>Trump’s inexplicably chummy relationships with dictators and despots demonstrated by his “love letters” to North Korean despot Kim Jong Un; his telling Chinese leader-for-life Xi Jinping that he approved of China’s imprisonment of more than one million Uighur Muslims in “reeducation camps”; and his seeming inability to criticize a leader — Vladimir Putin — who has ordered the use of illegal chemical weapons against opponents, murdered them, interfered in U.S. elections and reportedly even put bounties on the heads of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. </p>\n<p>Anthony Zinni was the former commander of Central Command. “I never endorsed a presidential candidate in my life, nor do I consider myself a Democrat or a Republican, but Trump’s unwillingness to say anything critical of Putin or even raise the issue of intelligence suggesting that his government has put bounties on the heads of U.S. service members in Afghanistan was more than I could take,” he said in an interview. “I have a son who has served multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, and President Trump didn’t even want to make it an issue? I also have a lot of friends overseas in the allied military and diplomatic communities, and they don’t understand why Trump is pushing away our friends and befriending our adversaries. For us military types who always want friends on our left and right, it doesn’t make any sense.”</p>\n<p>In his recent book “Rage,” investigative reporter Bob Woodward reports that Trump’s former DNI Dan Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana, remains convinced that Putin has compromising information and leverage over Trump, though he lacked the intelligence to prove it. “How else to explain the president’s behavior?” Woodward writes. “Coats could see no other explanation.”</p>\n<p>Michael Hayden served as director of both the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Intelligence Agency (NSA). He recalls watching the infamous 2018 Helsinki Summit meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin, when the president publicly accepted Putin’s denial of election interference over the repeated conclusions of his own Intelligence Community. In August the Intelligence Community’s top election security official told Congress that<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/russia/\"> Russia is once again targeting Trump’s political opposition</a> in this election cycle. </p>\n<p>“I watched President Trump’s Helsinki performance, when he said he didn’t ‘see any reason why’ Russia would have interfered in the 2016 election,’ and all I could say was ‘Oh my God!’ It was so awful, said Hayden. “When I talk with agency officials today, they tell me it’s impossible to break through the Fox News narrative that Trump relies on instead of his intelligence briefers. So we’ve dug a very deep hole under four years of Trump’s leadership. After four more years I fear that the America I know and served may not survive.”</p>\n<b>Corrupting Institutions </b>\n<p>The effects of nearly four years of Trump’s efforts to politicize nonpartisan institutions of the federal government and bend them to his personal agenda have been on stark display. Trump recently publicly pressured Attorney General William Barr to indict presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son in connection with allegations no one has been able to verify. The president and his advisers have reportedly discussed firing FBI Director Chris Wray after Election Day for failing to act on the president’s call. After Trump recently publicly called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to release more of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails in hopes of engineering another “October surprise,” Pompeo agreed. Just ahead of the first presidential debate, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/director-of-national-intelligence/\">Director of National Intelligence</a> John Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist who had sparse experience with intelligence matters before his nomination, selectively declassified unconfirmed intelligence suggesting that in 2016 it was the Clinton campaign that tried to tie Trump to Russia’s election interference. Some intelligence analysts believe that narrative is part of Russia’s disinformation campaign. </p>\n<p>“Attorney General Barr has been co-opted as the president’s personal lawyer. The Intelligence Community has been so grossly politicized that intelligence briefers withhold any negative intelligence on [Russian President] Vladimir Putin because the president doesn’t want to hear it, and Trump continues to try and corrupt virtually every government institution that has kept our democracy strong and free,” said William Cohen, a former Defense Secretary and Republican senator from Maine. “And the fact that President Trump now feels so unbound as to publicly pressure the attorney general to arrest his political opponents and critics, essentially one upping Richard Nixon’s enemies list, should send shudders through us all.” </p>\n<p>By now the White House playbook for politicizing and bringing independent institutions and agencies to heel is familiar. Shuffle the leadership until a compliant loyalist emerges; hollow out the bureaucracy by leaving positions in the second and third leadership tiers unfilled; rely on “acting” officials who often are unfamiliar with the place they are working and its topics so they can be more easily controlled and fired, thus circumventing the Senate’s constitutional role of “advise and consent”; and replace or simply fire independent watchdogs like Inspector Generals. Since May, Trump has removed or replaced five Inspector Generals, including watchdogs at the Departments of Defense, State, Transportation, Health and Human Services and in the Intelligence Community.</p>\n<p>“Donald Trump is the first president in our history who has sought to undermine every institution that promotes American values and democratic practices, from our judicial and voting systems, to Congress and the press, to our military and Intelligence Community. None has escaped his assault,” said retired Ambassador Robert Blackwill, former deputy National Security Advisor in the George W. Bush administration. “Personally it never occurred to me early on that President Trump would launch an all-out attack on our democratic institutions and processes, so my imagination failed me on that score. I’ve come to actually believe that he’s not a democrat with a small `d.’ I think his instincts are authoritarian.”</p>\n<p>Janet Napolitano is a former Secretary of Homeland Security. “Whole subcabinets at some government agencies and departments that are supposed to be Senate confirmed are now filled by ‘acting’ officials, and the instability and lack of quality people at the leadership level has done tremendous damage to our institutions,” she said in an interview. As the head of the Department of Homeland Security, Napolitano said she could never imagine the department being involved in the separation of immigrant children from their parents at the southern border, or the recent deployment of Customs and Border Protection paramilitary units to Portland, Oregon to crackdown on violent protests there, over the objections of state and local officials. </p>\n<p>“What we’ve seen is that President Trump is very good at tearing down institutions, but not so good at building them up,” said Napolitano.</p>\n<p>Despite its status by statutory law and tradition as one of the most nonpartisan institutions in the federal government, the Defense Department has not escaped the commander-in-chief’s efforts to enlist it for his political agenda. That became clear last June during Black Lives Matter protests against the killing in police custody of George Floyd. After proclaiming himself “your president of law and order” in a Rose Garden speech, Trump threatened to invoke the rarely-used Insurrection Act to send active-duty troops to “dominate” the streets of America. He then had National Guard troops and federal law enforcement violently disperse mostly peaceful protesters near Lafayette Square so that he could have a photo-op holding up a Bible at a nearby church. Flanking him that day as he strode across Lafayette Square were Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Mark Milley. Both later apologized for their presence at the square.</p>\n<p>“That whole incident around Lafayette Park was stunning to me, because those were mostly peaceful demonstrators exercising a right guaranteed by the Constitution that I’ve sworn allegiance to throughout my entire career,” said retired Gen. Peter Chiarelli, former Vice Chief of the Army. “This president has assaulted the military justice system on behalf of individuals charged with war crimes. He has ended the career of service members like [impeachment witness Lt. Col. Alexander] Vindman for doing his duty and what was right. He has maligned mail-in voting as a fraud and suggested that he might claim victory in a close election before all the ballots are counted, when as a service member I have voted absentee by mail my entire life. So like everyone else I’ve become numb after four years of this, but we have gone places in that time that I never dreamt we would go as a nation. I really do fear that the republic that I swore allegiance to is now under threat.” </p>\n<b>Pandemic Mismanagement</b>\n<p>For many of the retired flag-officers and senior national security leaders who signed the “Open Letter to America,” the president’s leadership during the coronavirus crisis was the final affront. Confronted with a global pandemic and knowing early on that Covid-19 was an especially deadly and contagious virus, Trump nevertheless told the American public that the virus would disappear “like a miracle” when the weather turned warm, with or without a vaccine; that “anybody that wants a test can get a test”; that if the nation simply stopped testing for the virus “we would have very few cases”: that injecting powerful cleaning agents like bleach might cure the virus; that Covid-19 “affects virtually nobody” younger than 18.

{"title": "JADC2 Needs Pentagon To Overhaul Data Management Policies", "publish_time": "2020-10-19 18:21:08", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: DoD has to undertake a foundational “redesign of how we manage our data” in order to succeed at creating a\nJoint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2)\nnetwork for orchestrating future information-centric warfare against peer adversaries, says Lt. Gen. Salty Saltzman, deputy chief of space operations for operations, cyber and nuclear.\n“Data management and the policies that go with security of that data management I see as one of the big hurdles,” he told the Mitchell Institute Friday.\nThere are both technical and policy challenges to overhauling the way DoD and the services handle data sharing, Saltzman explained. JADC2 will be dependent on allowing the rapid, seamless flow of vast amounts of data around the world to operators in the field — and across various levels of security, from unclassified to top secret. Nonetheless, access to that data has to be secured from enemy interception and/or disruption.\nThere are problems, he said, with “sharing information across multiple security layers,” Saltzman said, on top of the challenges in gathering all the data needed and making it easily available to those who need it.\n“These are currently things which are technically feasible, and that we’re struggling to implement because of the way we built our data structures, our pipes, etc. inside the Department of Defense,” he elaborated. “Our links-and-node structure is not really built for cloud-based structures and moving data around like that. We still like direct feeds, we like firewalls.”\nAnd despite the growing understanding among military leaders that information will need to flow freely, security policies used by DoD and the services are difficult to reform. Indeed, different services often apply security classification and access to data in different ways — complicating streamlining efforts.\nFurther, Saltzman said, many at DoD continue to take an overly conservative attitude toward secrecy. “We’re still a little bit locked in an older mindset, if you will, about how to manage data in the more responsive way that’s required by JADC2.” There is a need, he said, for “getting everybody on board that we’re\nnot\ntaking risk, we are shifting risk and managing risk across how we move data. That’s a mindset change that we’ve got to get to.”\nHe explained that the way to protect data and networks could no longer be based on a “moat with high walls.” Instead, a key to thinking about cybersecurity risks — particularly for the Space Force which is providing many of the data networks required to underpin JADC2 and for which cybersecurity is a fundamental part of its mission — is to recognize there will always be “bad actors infiltrating” networks.\n“I like to think of it more like an immune system in your body,” he said. “Things are going to come in because we have to stay connected, because we have to share information. There are going to be some vulnerabilities in there. We just have to recognize them immediately, and then be able to sort it out and mitigate it rapidly.”\nSaltzman ought to know. Back in 2017, he was charged with creating the Air Force’s forerunner to JADC2,\nthe Multi-Domain Command and Control (MDC2) program.\n“I’m a proud father of Multi-Domain C2, and watched it grow up into Joint All-Domain Command and Control,” he said with a smile.\nMost of the key principles that underpin JADC2 were developed under the MDC2 effort, Saltzman said. These include the reliance on common data standards, common Internet protocols, widely accessible data, and resilient, self-healing networks — all of which are now being demonstrated as feasible by the Air Force’s\nAdvanced Battle Management System (ABMS)\nOn Ramps and the Army’s\nProject Convergence\nexercises, he said.\n“So, I know we are on the right track,” he said. “What makes me happy is that I really do feel like the MDC2 team set a foundation of principles that are now being applied tangibly as we start to develop the systems and bring it to life, if you will.”\n“So, what doesn’t make me as happy is how long it takes,” he added. “This is just the nature sometimes, I think, of a large organization trying to synchronize across multiple fronts multiple services, multiple budget drills, multiple acquisition projects. And, and so, you know, there has to be a level of patience.”\nSpace Force Warfighting Construct\nIn his wide-ranging discussion, Saltzman also addressed what the Space Force has accomplished and where it still has serious work to do as it nears its first anniversary. One key issue\nthat has raised criticism from both some within DoD and many in the expert community\nis the need to flesh out\na “warfighting construct” to guide service priorities\nand resource investments.\nThis includes the question of how to balance between the service’s missions, as stated in the new\nCapstone “Spacepower” Doctrine,\nto “protect and defend” and to “provide independent options” for “strategic affects.” Indeed,\nthe Aerospace Corporation earlier this month\ncalled out the need for the Space Force, and the US government writ large, to have an robust and transparent debate about the use of offensive space weapons. That question is also at the\nheart of relations with allies,\nas well as stated US intentions of leading a global conversation on\nnorms of responsible and acceptable behavior in space\n.\n“We don’t know exactly how we want to behave in space,” Saltzman conceded.\nHowever, he explained that no one should be waiting for the Space Force to come out with “an 80-page document” that explains how it will prosecute future wars.\n“This will sound like I’m dodging, and I’m really trying to explain it as realistically as I can, because it’s so foundational. We don’t want to wait and wait and wait and design this perfect construct, and then roll it out, and then that’s the answer that we all have to march to for years to come. We think that’s not the right approach,” Saltzman said. “So, when you hear us talk about a ‘warfighting construct’ it’s not a singular thing, it’s actually a set of actions and processes that are going to be ongoing forever. And so it’s going to be incrementally rolled out as individual decisions are made that generally move us in the direction of the vision that Gen. [Jay] Raymond is trying to lay out for us.”\nThat said, he stressed that it is the Space Force’s job to figure out how to fight in space.\n“The nation, the Department of Defense is going to turn to the Space Force and say: ‘How are we going to contest and compete in the space domain to ensure that we maintain the strategic advantage that we’ve joined enjoyed for years?’ And that is squarely on our shoulders. Now you have service-level discussions — saying ‘how do we protect and defend what we already have’?”\n“And sometimes the best defense is a good offense,” he added. “And so we are exploring all those opportunities. Right now it’s mostly science and technology and R&D, because again we don’t want to throw good money after bad, but those discussions are ongoing because we think it’s our responsibility to take it on.”\nSaltzman noted that the Space Force is already looking, for example, to future platforms, including whether to continue with the X-37B experimental spaceplane, work on a follow-on program or do something totally new and different.\n“We’ve gotten a lot of great utility out of those vehicles — mostly from lessons learned and how to apply a reusable vehicle, how to get the most out of it, how to refurbish it. And so the lessons learned there are going to live forever, and we’re gonna try to apply those as much as we can,” he said.\n“Do we need to produce another one just like it? I it seems like that’s that’s kind of status quo,” he added. “I think that’s an example where maybe that technology has served its purpose and it’s time to start looking at the next available capability. … I can tell you we’re looking at it from a broader lens than just trying to enhance an older capability and technology.”\nHowever, Saltzman said, for the moment the Space Force is focusing on current needs, while at the same time trying to flesh out the longer-term “warfighting construct.”\n“I think, in the near term, you’re going to see enhancements to existing capabilities,” he said, citing the planned “block” upgrades GPS satellites and improved extremely high-frequency communications capabilities. The Space Force launched its fourth\nGPS III satellite\non Sept. 29, with six more in the pipleline. Lockheed Martin further is on contract to provide up to 22 more advanced versions called GPS Follow-On. Meanwhile, the service continues to work on its Protected Anti-Jam Satellite Communications (PATS) family of systems for replacing the alternative to the\nAdvanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite network for classified communications.\n“You’re going to see new capabilities to protect and defend,” Saltzman elaborated, “and satellites that are maybe more resilient than the big targets they’ve been in the past. That’s going to be our kind of near-term focus. And then, as we get the resources that play out over the next three four or five years, that’s when you might see, kind of like, where the new warfighting construct starts to be instantiated on orbit.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: DoD has to undertake a foundational “redesign of how we manage our data” in order to succeed at creating a <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/joint-all-domain-command-and-control-jadc2/\">Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2)</a> network for orchestrating future information-centric warfare against peer adversaries, says Lt.

Right now it’s mostly science and technology and R&D, because again we don’t want to throw good money after bad, but those discussions are ongoing because we think it’s our responsibility to take it on.”</p>\n<p>Saltzman noted that the Space Force is already looking, for example, to future platforms, including whether to continue with the X-37B experimental spaceplane, work on a follow-on program or do something totally new and different.</p>\n<p>“We’ve gotten a lot of great utility out of those vehicles — mostly from lessons learned and how to apply a reusable vehicle, how to get the most out of it, how to refurbish it. And so the lessons learned there are going to live forever, and we’re gonna try to apply those as much as we can,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Do we need to produce another one just like it? I it seems like that’s that’s kind of status quo,” he added. “I think that’s an example where maybe that technology has served its purpose and it’s time to start looking at the next available capability. … I can tell you we’re looking at it from a broader lens than just trying to enhance an older capability and technology.”</p>\n<p>However, Saltzman said, for the moment the Space Force is focusing on current needs, while at the same time trying to flesh out the longer-term “warfighting construct.”</p>\n<p>“I think, in the near term, you’re going to see enhancements to existing capabilities,” he said, citing the planned “block” upgrades GPS satellites and improved extremely high-frequency communications capabilities. The Space Force launched its fourth <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/gps-iii/\">GPS III satellite</a> on Sept. 29, with six more in the pipleline. Lockheed Martin further is on contract to provide up to 22 more advanced versions called GPS Follow-On. Meanwhile, the service continues to work on its Protected Anti-Jam Satellite Communications (PATS) family of systems for replacing the alternative to the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/advanced-extremely-high-frequency-aehf-satellites/\">Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite network for classified communications. </a></p>\n<p>“You’re going to see new capabilities to protect and defend,” Saltzman elaborated, “and satellites that are maybe more resilient than the big targets they’ve been in the past. That’s going to be our kind of near-term focus. And then, as we get the resources that play out over the next three four or five years, that’s when you might see, kind of like, where the new warfighting construct starts to be instantiated on orbit.”</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["ABMS", "Advanced Battle Management System", "Aerospace Corporation", "air force", "army", "Gen.

{"title": "Army Tries (Again) To Protect Stryker: Rafael or Rheinmetall?", "publish_time": "2021-01-08 20:04:19", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr.Arie Egozi"], "content": "WASHINGTON: This year, the Army will fire live anti-tank warheads at two rival Active Protection Systems to assess how best to protect lightweight armored vehicles like its 8×8\nStryker\n. The contenders in this “live fire characterization activity” – it isn’t officially a test – will be the German\nRheinmetall\nActive Defense System\n(ADS) and the Israeli\nRafael\nTrophy Vehicle Protection System\n(VPS).\nNot\nparticipating, our sources tell us, is the American\nArtis\nIron Curtain\n, which was the Army’s original pick to protect the Stryker but was subsequently\nrejected after Army testers found it wanting\n.\nNow, the Rheinmetall ADS and the Rafael Trophy VPS won’t be installed on actual Stryker vehicles. Instead, they’ll be set up on specially designed armored targets. That will allow the Army to measure precisely what damage, if any, gets through the active protection systems from different kinds of attacks.\n“The Army intends to conduct live fire characterization activities with the two hard-kill active protection systems on platform agnostic test rigs,” said Ashley John, spokesperson for the\nProgram Executive Officer – Ground Combat Systems\n(PEO-GCS), in an email to\nBreaking Defense\n. “The performance data collected on these two systems will help determine potential suitability for ground combat vehicles, to include Stryker.”\nA “hard kill” system, like ADS and VPS, is one that physically shoots down incoming anti-tank missiles and rockets. “Soft kill” decoys and jamming, by contrast, just make the enemy miss. Hard-kill has worked well on heavy tanks. Israel, Russia and the US all use it. But, as the Army has painfully discovered, it’s much harder to get it to work on lighter vehicles – which need protection the most. For the Stryker in particular, while the reliable, affordable vehicle has become an Army workhorse around the world — with variants carrying everything from infantry to\nanti-aircraft missiles\n,\n30mm cannon\n,\njammers\n, and even\nlasers\n— the service has struggled for years to make it more survivable in high-intensity combat.\nWhat’s the hold-up? Historically, hard-kill Active Protection Systems are heavy and bulky; they need a lot of electrical power to run radars and targeting computers; and when they intercept incoming warheads, they may cause them to prematurely detonate or burst into shrapnel – “residual penetration” that a heavily armored tank can shrug off, but which a Stryker or other lightly armored vehicle cannot.\nThe Germans and Israelis have taken different approaches to solving this problem. Rheinmetall’s ADS uses\na large number of small explosive charges\ndistributed around the vehicle, computer-controlled to detonate at the precise millisecond to cut apart incoming warheads just before they detonate. Rafael’s Trophy uses a compact missile launcher, which\nlobs mini-missiles at incoming anti-tank missiles and rockets\nto intercept them further out. There’s a big debate over which of the two approaches is safer, both for the vehicle being protected and for foot troops or nearby civilians.\nRheinmetall has not made public which countries, if any, use its ADS. Rafael’s Trophy has a 10-year track record in Israel. It’s been in combat on Israeli Merkava tanks since 2011 and was\npicked for the American M1 Abrams in 2018\n.\nJust this week, Rafael and its American partner, Leonardo DRS,\nannounced\nthey had completed urgent deliveries of enough systems to protect every M1 Abrams in four Army brigades. How many is that? While the Army and the contractors are leery of giving exact figures, a typical\nArmored Brigade Combat Team\nhas six tank companies with a total of 84 Abrams, plus backup vehicles in case of breakdowns. With enough Trophy APS now delivered for four brigades, that would bring the total close to 400 systems – and a further contract for spare Trophies is in the works.\nBut the current Trophy APS is a multi-ton system. So while it’s been installed successfully on 60-plus-ton main battle tanks – Abrams and Merkava – the usual set of radars and launchers just doesn’t fit on lighter vehicles like the 30-ton M2 Bradley or the 20-ton Stryker.\nBy contrast, “distributed systems” like Rheinmetall’s ADS or Artis’s Iron Curtain rely on smaller sensors and relatively tiny, lightweight explosive charges. That means they can be installed on lighter vehicles – potentially even unarmored trucks.\nCurrently, the Army is buying\na rival Israel active protection system for its Bradleys\n, Elbit’s Iron Fist-Light. But\nto compete for Bradley\nand Stryker, Rafael and Leonardo have developed a slimmed-down variant of Trophy, the Trophy Vehicle Protection System, that they say is up to 40 percent lighter. (The exact weight depends on how it’s installed on a specific vehicle). The latest version of Trophy VPS also requires less power to operate its radars and other electronics, a big bonus for vehicles like Bradley whose aging electrical systems are already overloaded.\nYet, the companies claim Trophy VPS performs just as well in testing as the full-size version. It even carries the same number of mini-missiles as the original, which is crucial, because that allows it to shoot down the same number of incoming threats before running out of ammo. But almost every other component has been modernized and miniaturized. Since Trophy system was first used in combat in 2011, sensors, processors, and power systems have all gotten lighter. The new components also consume less power, which lets the power supply shrink even more. The companies have even streamlined the wiring and used new, lighter-weight materials in the physical structure.\nThe resulting lightweight Trophy was first tested, to our knowledge, in Israel in 2018, installed on a M2 Bradley chassis. The US Army did at least some testing in 2019 to see how Trophy VPS would work on\nStryker\n.

{"title": "EXCLUSIVE: Army Airpower To Strike Deep In EDGE21 Wargame", "publish_time": "2021-02-19 17:42:36", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: The Army will host an interservice aviation exercise in May to prove its\nChief of Staff\n’s recent claim that the service can bring\n“speed and range”\nto\nfuture battlefields\n. Known as EDGE21 — Experimentation Demonstration Gateway Event 2021 – and held at\nDugway Proving Ground\n, the experimental wargame will be the Army’s latest bid to prove it plays a vital role in far-ranging and fast-paced\nAll Domain Operations\n.\nEDGE21 both builds on the airpower aspects of last fall’s\nProject Convergence\n2020 exercise and helps prepare for the upcoming\nConvergence 2021\n. In an exclusive interview, the head of aviation modernization at Army Futures Command, Brig. Gen. Walter Rugen, gave me some striking examples of how much farther he plans to push this time, in terms of both physical range and tactical complexity.\nDuring last year’s Project Convergence, UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters launched a swarm of\nALTIUS\nmini-drones — known in Army jargon as Air-Launched Effects (ALE) – to\n“flood the zone” out to more than 60 kilometers\n(37 miles). In EDGE21, Rugen said, the Black Hawks will carry a bigger drone — roughly six feet long — developed by the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) and known as ALE-Large. Its exact capabilities are classified, he said, the new air-launched drone will reach out “hundreds of kilometers.”\nAnother crucial new technology making its appearance at EDGE21 will be the Army’s new drone-borne jamming pod, known as\nMFEW (Multi-Function Electronic Warfare) Air-Large\n. The pod wasn’t ready in time for Project Convergence last fall, Rugen said. It will dramatically increase the Army’s ability to detect and disrupt enemy transmissions, and blind anti-aircraft defenses so friendly aircraft can slip through, lessons learned from Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.\nMarine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters will also fly in EDGE21, Rugen told me.\nThe stealth jets played an intriguing role in Project Convergence last fall\n, passing targeting data to and from Army forces – but the Marine pilots were a late addition to the Army-run exercise, and their participation was limited. This time, the Marines were part of the plan for EDGE21 from the beginning, Rugen said, and “there’s far more breadth and depth to the task we’re asking them to do, [with] much greater collaboration on joint kill chains.”\nGround forces will participate as well. Besides Special Operations teams (which he wouldn’t discuss in any detail), Rugen said, the commander of the\n82\nnd\nAirborne Division\n– the Army’s rapid-response force, which has been experimenting extensively with artificial intelligence – will bring his tactical command post (TAC) and coordinate key parts of the operation. (This streamlined HQ element isn’t the same as bringing the full-up division Tactical Operations Center, or TOC, which is a notoriously big target).\nOnce the 82\nnd\ncommander decides the F-35s and drones have sufficiently beaten down the simulated “enemy” anti-aircraft defenses, he will order something that was not attempted in Project Convergence: an air assault. Black Hawk helicopters will fly in infantry soldiers equipped with the Army’s brand-new augmented-reality targeting goggles, the\nIntegrated Visual Augmentation System\n. “We’re jumping into our first IVAS-enabled air assault,” Rugen told me.\nIt’s a big technical challenge to coordinate all these different forces – manned and unmanned; air and ground, plus satellite support from space; Army, Special Operations, and Marines – over long distances. So the command, control, and communications network for EDGE21 will be beefed up significantly over what was available last fall, Rugen told me. The improvements include upgrades to the\nTSM\nwaveform and the addition of two entirely new waveforms. The reinforced network will be much more resilient to disruption, he said, and “it adds much greater range” – which makes the whole scaled-up operation possible.\nOverall, Rugen told me, the objective is to “out-tempo our enemies [with] multiple simultaneous engagements.. .both kinetic and non-kinetic.” In other words, you want to bombard the enemy with many different types of attacks at once, from physical bombs and troop landings to electronic jamming, and keep up that furious pace until the adversary is overwhelmed. Imagine the enemy is a baseball batter, stepping up to home plate, only to discover the US has five different pitchers throwing fastballs, curveballs, and spitballs at him at once.\nNow, EDGE21 is hardly the final word on Army aviation, but rather a sizable step in a long march to the future force. Some of the systems employed will be early versions of actual future weapons, such as the ALE-Large helicopter-launched drone, the MFEW-Air-Large electronic warfare pod, and the IVAS targeting goggles.\nOthers will be surrogates. The network, for instance, connects just a fraction of the different elements envisioned for a future all-service\nJoint All-Domain Command & Control\n(JADC2) system. As for the physical aircraft, the UH-60 Black Hawks will be standing in for the\nFuture Long-Range Assault Aircraft\n(FLRAA), while heavily modified Special Operations Grey Eagle drones will stand in for the\nFuture Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft\n(FARA). FLRAA and FARA are part of a larger push for revolutionary Future Vertical Lift (FVL) designs to replace existing helicopters with much faster, longer-ranged machines.\n“We’re not waiting for the truck to be delivered,” Rugen said of FARA and FLRAA. Instead, the service is testing out new tactics, technologies, and interconnecting architectures with what it has on hand, today. That way it can work out the bugs and figure out what it’s missing as early as possible, while it’s still relatively easy and affordable to fix it.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The Army will host an interservice aviation exercise in May to prove its <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/gen.-james-mcconville/\">Chief of Staff</a>’s recent claim that the service can bring <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/02/army-chief-to-navy-air-force-weve-got-speed-range/\">“speed and range”</a> to <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/10/low-fast-networked-lethal-army-airpower-in-future-wars/\">future battlefields</a>.

Instead, the service is testing out new tactics, technologies, and interconnecting architectures with what it has on hand, today.

Rob Wittman’s new leadership role on the House Armed Services Committee will place the veteran lawmaker at the center of major debates over Pentagon funding and a series of hard choices over Navy’s looming modernization bill.\nWhile Republicans remain in the minority in the House, the influential panel’s top Republican, Rep. Mike Rogers, named Wittman vice ranking member Thursday as the Hill prepares for the Biden administration’s 2022 budget and accompanying reviews of the Navy’s shipbuilding plan and the military’s global force posture, with major implications for how the force is arrayed overseas.\nWittman, who serves as the ranking member on the seapower and projection forces subcommittee, “will be an invaluable addition to our leadership team,” Rogers said.\nThe armed services committees of the newly installed 117th Congress will tackle a list of weighty issues while balancing the fallout from a bitter election season that saw rioters storm the Capitol building to interrupt the vote to certify the Electoral College votes to affirm President Joe Biden’s victory. The sharp bipartisan split in the country and on the Hill will likely color everything this Congress does.\nIn an interview Thursday, Wittman remained hopeful about the ability of the HASC to rise above the din. “I think HASC will continue the great tradition of bipartisanship,” Wittman said. “I know my conversations with [Seapower Chairman] Joe Courtney and [HASC Chairman] Adam Smith have all been about what we’re going to do together going forward, and yes there’s a higher degree of tension back and forth between the two parties, but we have always been able to transcend that in the HASC. In my conversations to this point I don’t see anything that’s going to change that.”\nIn January, Wittman joined HASC Ranking Member Mike Rogers in voting against certifying Electoral College votes in states Biden won, despite no evidence there were substantial voting irregularities. Tweeting\ntwo days\nbefore a violent, Trump-supporting mob stormed the building and killed a Capitol Police officer, Wittman said “I am in full support of objecting to electors in order to debate and examine of election results in states where Constitutional questions have been raised.” He later accepted the electoral victory of President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, saying he had no intention of trying to overturn the election.\nThe new Congress has just a few weeks to settle in before they will have to wrestle with the 2022 federal budget, which will likely stand as the Biden administration’s first declaration on the national security issues that will require buy-in from both parties in Congress.\n“We understand going forward it’s going to be about maintaining budget levels,” Wittman said. “I don’t think there’s going to be any increases in the budget, but maintaining budget levels in order to do the things necessary” to fund the Pentagon’s modernization, particularly in the new shipbuilding plan the Pentagon will submit with the budget this spring.\nThe fights over funding within the Pentagon will likely be hard — Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley\npredicted budget “bloodletting”\n— but many, including Wittman, say changes to how the Pentagon splits funds between the services need to happen to counter the growing Chinese military might in the Pacific.\n“In order to do the things necessary in the shipbuilding plan you’re going to have to find additional resources to put into the [shipbuilding] account,” Wittman said. The Navy is working to scrape up more internal savings by retiring some of its oldest ships — if Congress allows — but the other services will likely have to be bill payers, as well.\nMilley threw his weight behind the Navy’s receiving the lion’s share of Pentagon funding in the future in order to ramp up its presence in the Indo-Pacific, something Witttman supports. The discussion about the one-third/one-third/one-third funding formula which has generally guided Pentagon spending is very much in play, and Wittman questioned whether that is applicable today.\n“Even General Milley said we probably ought to rethink that because if you’re going to have a necessary presence in the Indo-Pacific it’s going to take additional resources for the Navy/Marine Corps team, and that’s not in any way shape or form critical of the Air Force or the Army, it’s just the reality of what we have to do.”\nThose decisions at the White House and Pentagon, and the debates they’ll stir on the Hill, will surely lead to debate on the Senate and House’s armed services committees, where and all fall under the shadow of the chaos of January, where the peaceful transfer of power to the Biden administration was under attack.\nIn December, Wittman also joined House Republicans in sending an a\nmicus brief\nto the Supreme Court supporting an effort in Texas to overturn the Biden victory. That case was swiftly\nrejected\nby the court. “This was not about overturning the election, I knew my vote wasn’t going to do that,” Wittman said in the\ndays after\nthe insurrectionist riot and his vote, but said he was concerned about the unconstitutionality of how the vote was administered.\nSimilarly, Rogers cited “far too many instances of alleged voter fraud that have called the legitimacy of the election results into question,” adding elections “should be free, fair and transparent. The 2020 election was not.”\nThere has been no credible evidence of voter suppression or other voting irregularities provided before or after the Jan. 6 vote despite the lawmakers objections, though Wittman later issued a statement wishing Biden and Harris “the blessings of good health and sound judgement as our nation navigates these unprecedented times.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: Longtime seapower advocate Rep.

{"title": "DoD Likely To Miss 2021 Deadline For Counter-Drone Weapon", "publish_time": "2021-02-02 19:28:00", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: The Pentagon will choose a first round of industry-developed systems for shooting down small drones in early 2022, according to officials at the the\nJoint Counter-small Unmanned Aerial Systems Office\n(JCO).\nThat initial set of capabilities is known as “Low-Collateral Effects Increment No. 1,” JCO Director Army Major Gen. Sean Gainey told reporters in a briefing today. The plan is to figure out what industry has “ready to deliver; ready to get it out to the field, pretty quickly.”\nThe term “low-collateral effects” refers to counter drone systems that can be employed with few negative consequences for non-enemy aircraft and electronic systems near the field of intercept. Those types of weapons are the first focus in implementing\nDoD’s strategy to defeat small drones, released in early January.\n“JCO conducted an assessment of all the affiliated counter-UAS capabilities [within DoD] and essentially determined the selection of the current systems for future investment, based on a criteria such as effectiveness usability sustainment and the integration –and that was one of our focuses, integration — into a common C2 [command and control system],” Gainey elaborated. “With that assessment now complete … we’re now continuing to work with industry to really bring these interim systems to full maturity, or to eventually replace them with follow-on, enduring solutions, and we’ve reached out to industry to help us move forward.”\nWhile Gainey didn’t directly answer a question about whether any system would be available by Sept. 30, as mandated in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the timeframe provided by JCO officials suggests the answer is ‘no.’\nArmy Col. Greg Soulé, JCO director of acquisition & resources, said the office is reviewing industry proposals sent in response to a\nJan. 22 request for information (RFI)\n. The focus of these first trials, to be held in April at the Yuma Proving Ground, is on “low-collateral effects interceptors,” he said. The RFI explains: “Specific, but not limited, uses would include defeating small UAS in urban environments, over sensitive sites, or situations where the rules of engagement would not allow kinetic effects.”\nSoulé says they’ll pick a down-select group to provide oral presentations, and then decide who comes to the trials. Based on the results — and “working with the Air Force as the designated service lead for this capability area” — the JCO will “compare [chosen systems] against other similar low-collateral effect interceptor solutions that are already under government contract” and assess their add-on value. “[L]ate ’21, I believe, is the current Air Force plan” for finishing that review, he said. “And then, in the ’22 timeframe, selecting that initial capability for procurement and fielding to the force.”\nThe Air Force, and the Army’s\nRapid Capabilities & Critical Technologies Office\n(RCCTO), which leads ground-force development of cutting-edge tech like\nhigh-powered lasers\nand\nhypersonic missiles,\nare partners with the JCO in the C-sUAS endeavor.\nThe April trials are only a first. There will be follow-on industry solicitations and trials for other types of low-collateral damage weapons, specifically those based on directed-energy, the JCO officials said.\nThere will certainly be “follow-on efforts … to look at the next set of solutions and/or payloads that would also be a part of this low-collateral effects interceptor package,” Soulé said.\nThe end goal is a “system of systems, including kinetic; high-energy lasers being tested in field right now; and, eventually, high-powered microwaves,” Gainey said. “We’re deploying those [laser] systems right now, under combat into theaters right now, and seeing a lot of progress with high-energy lasers. Also, simultaneously, we’re working — as most of you probably know — through the Air Force work in high-powered microwave capability that will also be deployed pretty soon. So those two capabilities — which although they’re designed as components into architecture, can potentially become inherent systems themselves — are being tested.”\nThe Air Force plans to do field testing on its Tactical High Power Microwave Operational Responder (THOR). It was expected to be deployed to Africa last fall but that was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. While there was some kerfluffle late last year about whether THOR had already been fielded,\nthe bottom line is that THOR will be deployed sometime in 2021.\nAs various C-sUAS systems are deployed, Gainey stressed that integrated C2 is key to ensuring cross-service functionality, and that they can plug and play with the future\nJoint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2)\nsystem, as well as the “common data language”\nbeing developed by the University of California\nfor DoD’s Research & Engineering office (OSDR&E).\n“When we first started off, we recognized command and control was going to be the center of gravity for interoperability.

Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: Even as it labors over uplinks and downloads for its virtual\nGlobal Force Next\nconference this week, the\nAssociation of the US Army\naims to do its next big conference, its flagship Annual Meeting, at least partially in person in Washington, DC.\n“Hopefully, the city will cooperate and we can get back into the [Walter E. Washington] Convention Center,” said retired Lt. Gen. Guy Swan, AUSA VP for education. “It won’t be on the scale of the historic event you’ve been to” in past Octobers, he said: The goal is “a reasonable in-person presence combined with a virtual presence.”\nAUSA definitely looks forward to having in-person events again, especially the conference halls packed with exhibitors that are a major source of income. Virtual sponsorships fill only part of the gap. That said, “the revenue side of this [pandemic] hasn’t been catastrophic,” Swan told me: “While we have lower revenue, we do have lower costs” – since you’re not physically renting facilities, book hotel rooms, and flying staff around – “[so] it’s probably a wash.”\nAt the same time, the virtual dimension forced on conferences by COVID is never going to go away, Swan emphasized, because it expands the potential audience too much to give it up. And that’s just one of many lessons AUSA has learned during the pandemic.\nIt’s been a year of tremendous adaptation – and not a little whiplash – for AUSA’s staff. In March 2020, with COVID erupting nationwide,\nAUSA abruptly canceled its spring conference in Huntsville, Ala.\n“we didn’t have any time to react,” Swan told me. “It was canceled completely.... Our advance team was headed there and we literally stopped them at the airport.”\nOver the next five months, AUSA wrestled with whether to hold its annual meeting in person or virtually, opting only in August to hold\nthe October event entirely online\n. “We had lessons learned” from that experience, Swan said, all of which they’ve implemented for this week’s Global Force conference.\nFirst and foremost: Virtual conferences take a lot of human labor to set up. “It was staggering in terms of staff demand,” Swan told me, “hundreds and hundreds of hours putting together a virtual event... a three or four-fold expansion of what our staff has to do.”\nWhy so much work? For one thing, while it’s hard enough lining up speakers for an in-person event, once you do confirm them, they book their own plane tickets and hotel rooms, and then they just show up. For a virtual conference, you have to spend a lot of time checking each individual speaker’s connection, because each individual speaker may have a different combination of hardware, software, and (especially) firewalls that interact differently – and potentially very poorly – with the system the conference is using.\n“We learned that lesson the hard way in October, when some people disappeared into the ether when we were trying to get them to speak,” Swan said. So for Global Force, AUSA is making sure to hold technical rehearsals for all its panels – not to practice remarks but to ensure all the digital connections really connect.\nAnother “big lesson,” Swan told me: people’s attention span while sitting at a screen is significantly shorter than in-person. At last fall’s virtual Annual Meeting, panels routinely ran for over an hour, as they do at the in-person version. That was too much, AUSA learned. So for Global Force, panels max out at an hour, keynote speeches at 30 minutes.\n[UPDATE: Actually, a lot of panels went 75 minutes — still shorter than the traditional norm]\nOf course, a lot of people don’t go to conferences for the panels and speeches: They go to network with government officials and industry executives in the hallways and at exhibitor displays. That’s not physically possible during the pandemic, but for Global Force, AUSA is implementing networking chatrooms and virtual appointments.\nSometimes all this becomes too difficult. AUSA cancelled its annual LANPAC conference, normally held in Hawaii, because the Pacific audience is so spread out it’s impossible to schedule events at times that work for everyone: “You’re talking time zones from Washington to Seoul,” Swan said.\nBut for a US-focused event like this week’s Global Force or October’s annual meeting, Swan told me, the ability to reach a widely dispersed audience has proven to be a huge advantage.

{"title": "US Industry Struggles To Strip Chinese Tech From Networks", "publish_time": "2021-02-22 20:34:48", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: More than two years after Congress passed two laws to strip Chinese hardware and software from US defense and telecommunications supply chains, industry is struggling to figure out how.\n“No one really has the answers on some of this stuff,” Nick Jones, director of regulatory policy at the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA), said in an interview.\nOne key problem, Jones explained, is that neither DoD nor the\nFCC\nhave issued lists of what equipment is banned by the laws.\n“Good national security intentions, but poor execution thus far,” one telecoms expert summed up.\nThe\n2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)\nincluded section 889 which prohibits the federal government, contractors, and federal grant/loan recipients from buying or even\nusing\n“covered telecommunication equipment or services” from Huawei, ZTE, Hytera, Hikvision and Dahua and their subsidiaries as a “substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system.” It also allows the Defense Secretary, the Director of National Intelligence and/or the FBI Director to “\nadd to the list at anytime.”\nDoD, the General Services Agency (GSA) and NASA in\nJuly 2020 issued a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) “interim rule”\nto implement the provision, and followed up with\na second one in late August\naimed at helping companies through the process of certifying compliance.\nCongress in 2019 also passed the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019\ndirecting the FCC to figure out how to remove and replace Chinese equipment from US telecoms networks, known as the “rip and replace” program. The bill also provided $1.89 billion in FCC funds to help small and rural broadband providers comply.\nThe FCC issued a new draft rule Thursday\nthat would expand the pool of potential aid recipients — upping the cap from firms with 2 million customers to those with 10 million.\nWhile the FCC rules do not directly affect most of the defense industrial base, DoD is working closely with affected commercial telecoms providers to speed\n5G wireless connectivity\nto military users at home and abroad.\nFor example,\nDoD in October awarded some $600 million in contracts for 5G experiments\nat five bases belonging to the Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps.\nJoseph Evans,\ntechnical director for 5G in the DoD undersecretariat for research & engineering, said the awards involve “over three dozen contracts [with] prime contractors [and] over 100 total companies, over half of them non-traditional” – that is, commercial tech companies rather than longstanding defense contractors. (Awardees range from telecoms giants AT&T and Nokia to the tiny Shared Spectrum Company that has 14 employees.)\nIt is the second part of the 2019 NDAA Section 889 (Part B) — which covers third-party providers of systems, parts and services — that is causing the most trouble for defense contractors, Jones explained. Smaller firms in particular are struggling, he added, since they don’t have the resources the big primes do to engage legal and regulatory expertise to help.\nPart B “has caused greater headaches for US Government contractors because of its broader reach,”\nstated a November blog post by law firm Baker MacKenzie.\n“It is not necessary that the Covered Equipment be used as part of the contract with the US Government to fall within the scope of the prohibition; rather, it is sufficient only that the offeror uses Covered Equipment as part of its overall business, making the breadth and applicability of this rule quite wide.”\nFor example, corporate leaders are scratching their heads over whether Chinese-made cameras for facility security are barred by Section 889, and what can be bought to replace the prohibited gear, Jones said.\n“You know, security cameras looking at parking lots. So we’ve had people just rip those out, or turn them off,” he elaborated. “And there’s no replacement lists anywhere. Also cameras for things like simulation training and simulation applications that may have some of these [barred] components in there, and again, there’s no list.”\n“The guidance/law is at the policy level and implementation is going to be hard, in part because nobody was watching too closely to see just how far these Chinese components and hardware have infiltrated U.S. businesses,” the telecoms expert said. “It’s going to take a while, and cost a lot, to purge them and I doubt it will be effective.\n“Chip-level compromises, at the nation state level, are very hard to defeat and imposing this on industry without specific guidance makes it harder. It’s also imposing real costs on industry, which only makes sense if enforcement / market compliance incentives will follow,” the expert added.\nInterestingly, the FCC regulations might actually help defense contractors implement Section 889, Jones noted, because the FCC is actually required to publish a list of barred equipment — a list that is expected to be released sometime next month. Further, that list will be based in part on determinations by DoD and the Intelligence Community as to what specific equipment should be deemed high risk,\naccording to the FCC.\nTracking down the hundreds of subsidiaries for the five Chinese firms blacklisted in the NDAA also is a Sisyphean task, Jones said. While DoD has provided some guidelines for how contractors should conduct a “reasonable inquiry” into whether they (and their suppliers) are complying with the law, he explained, the Pentagon hasn’t actually name names of blacklisted subsidiaries. (Nor has the FCC provided a subsidiary list in its regulations implementing the rip and replace law.)", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-102659\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/19_1009_cisa_5g-main.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"675\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/19_1009_cisa_5g-main.jpeg 675w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/19_1009_cisa_5g-main-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/19_1009_cisa_5g-main-210x140.jpeg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\"/>WASHINGTON: More than two years after Congress passed two laws to strip Chinese hardware and software from US defense and telecommunications supply chains, industry is struggling to figure out how.</p>\n<p>“No one really has the answers on some of this stuff,” Nick Jones, director of regulatory policy at the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA), said in an interview.</p>\n<p>One key problem, Jones explained, is that neither DoD nor the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/federal-communications-commission-fcc/\">FCC</a> have issued lists of what equipment is banned by the laws.</p>\n\n<p>“Good national security intentions, but poor execution thus far,” one telecoms expert summed up.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/ndaa-2019/\">2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)</a> included section 889 which prohibits the federal government, contractors, and federal grant/loan recipients from buying or even <em>using</em> “covered telecommunication equipment or services” from Huawei, ZTE, Hytera, Hikvision and Dahua and their subsidiaries as a “substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system.” It also allows the Defense Secretary, the Director of National Intelligence and/or the FBI Director to “<a href=\"https://thecgp.org/policy-involvement/what-federal-contractors-need-to-know-about-section-889\">add to the list at anytime.”</a></p>\n\n<p>DoD, the General Services Agency (GSA) and NASA in<a href=\"https://www.acquisition.gov/FAR-Case-2019-009/889_Part_B\"> July 2020 issued a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) “interim rule”</a> to implement the provision, and followed up with <a href=\"https://www.governmentcontractslaw.com/2020/08/the-far-council-publishes-second-interim-rule-implementing-ndaa-section-889a1b/\">a second one in late August</a> aimed at helping companies through the process of certifying compliance.</p>\n<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/09/sen-warner-knocks-congress-on-election-security-iot-huawei/\">Congress in 2019 also passed the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019</a> directing the FCC to figure out how to remove and replace Chinese equipment from US telecoms networks, known as the “rip and replace” program.

The contract follows the successful test firing of a Harpoon from the USS Olympia submarine during the RIMPAC 2018 exercise off the coast of Hawaii, marking the first time the missile had been fired from an American sub since 1997.\nThe Pentagon has been working on getting its ship-killing prowess back since the Obama administration, when then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter launched the\nThird Offset Strategy\naimed at developing new technologies, and repurposing old ones, to make the force more lethal, at moderate cost — and to do it quickly.\nThe increased missile range also fits with the emerging Navy strategy which accepts the risk posed by precision weapons and stand-off capabilty developed by China, in particular. A “tri-service” strategy released by the Navy, Marines and Coast Guard in December pointed out the plan is to continue to develop “ready, forward-deployed naval forces [which] will accept calculated tactical risks and adopt a more assertive posture in our day-to-day operations.”\nThe work began to pay off in the fielding of the over-the-horizon Naval Strike Missile, made by a team made up of Raytheon and Norway-based Kongsberg.

Indeed, Brown during his nomination hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee back in June suggested\nDoD and Congress might want to consider a roles and missions review\non that issue.\nBrown said yesterday that he has talked to\nArmy Chief James McConville\nabout their respective long-range strike missions. “We both provide that capability, as well as the other services. And this is why I think we’ve really got to, as we go through this Joint Warfighting Concept, [be] looking at our offensive capability, but also looking at our defensive capability.”\nBut, he stressed, there also are potential “disconnects” between the services on the other Joint Warfighting Concept sub-concepts as well.\nHe and Army Chief Gen. James McConville have agreed\nto cooperate in the development of each service’s plans for implementing\nJoint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2).\nThis includes figuring out how to ensure that any new efforts to build modern, software-based C2 systems under the the Army’s\nProject Convergence\nand the Air Force’s\nAdvanced Battle Management System\n(ABMS) are fully interoperable.\nBrown also has initiated talks with Chief of Naval Operations Adm.

Meanwhile, the Army has released its own top-level strategy, the\nArmy Installations Strategy\n, for preventing what it sees as inevitable attacks on its bases by Russia or China in a future conflict.\nBrown said he believes that as the\nJoint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)\nsorts through what is needed to implement the Joint Warfighting Concept, it will help the services identify missions where they may need to deconflict their plans, as well as identify gaps between them that need filling.\n“The JROC will be a little more directive on things that we need to do to ensure we have joint capability going forward,” Brown elaborated.\nThat said, he stressed that ultimately only\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin\ncan really make the call to undertake any review of specific mission sets, and institute changes.\nBrown said that one way OSD can, in effect, decide who does what mission set is via the budget approval process. “But I do think, because we have this new team” at OSD — led by Austin and Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks — “these are conversations we need to have as we go forward.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The Air Force Chief of Staff is calling on the Pentagon leadership to launch a targeted roles and missions review of the key functional areas of future <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/all-domain-operations/\">All Domain Operations</a> detailed in the impending <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/joint-warfighting-concept/\">Joint Warfighting Concept</a><a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/gen-cq-brown/\">. </a></p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t actually go through a complete roles and missions [review],” <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/gen-cq-brown/\">Air Force Chief of Staff Gen.

Indeed, Brown during his nomination hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee back in June suggested <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/06/cq-brown-brings-pacific-focus-keen-interest-in-joint-ops/\">DoD and Congress might want to consider a roles and missions review</a> on that issue.</p>\n<p>Brown said yesterday that he has talked to <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/gen-james-mcconville/\">Army Chief James McConville</a> about their respective long-range strike missions. “We both provide that capability, as well as the other services. And this is why I think we’ve really got to, as we go through this Joint Warfighting Concept, [be] looking at our offensive capability, but also looking at our defensive capability.”</p>\n<p>But, he stressed, there also are potential “disconnects” between the services on the other Joint Warfighting Concept sub-concepts as well.</p>\n<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/10/army-air-force-get-serious-on-jadc2-joint-exercises-in-2021/\">He and Army Chief Gen. James McConville have agreed</a> to cooperate in the development of each service’s plans for implementing <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/joint-all-domain-command-control/\">Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2).</a> This includes figuring out how to ensure that any new efforts to build modern, software-based C2 systems under the the Army’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/project-convergence/\">Project Convergence</a> and the Air Force’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/abms/\">Advanced Battle Management System</a> (ABMS) are fully interoperable.\n<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/10/air-force-chief-seeks-navy-chiefs-cooperation-on-jadc2/\">Brown also has initiated talks with Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday</a> on JADC2 and the Navy’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/project-overmatch/\">Project Overmatch</a>, but no public agreement has been announced.\n<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/logistics-under-attack/\">Logistics under attack</a> is yet another area of potential conflict among the services, with the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/12/air-force-to-army-navy-pay-the-tax-for-space-air-power-protect-our-bases/\">Air Force already signaling that it expects the other services to pony up more</a> support for air base defense. Meanwhile, the Army has released its own top-level strategy, the <a href=\"https://www.asaie.army.mil/Public/SI/doc/Army_Installations_Strategy_(AIS)_FINAL_Signed.pdf\">Army Installations Strategy</a>, for preventing what it sees as inevitable attacks on its bases by Russia or China in a future conflict.\n<p>Brown said he believes that as the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/joint-requirements-oversight-council/\">Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)</a> sorts through what is needed to implement the Joint Warfighting Concept, it will help the services identify missions where they may need to deconflict their plans, as well as identify gaps between them that need filling.</p>\n<p>“The JROC will be a little more directive on things that we need to do to ensure we have joint capability going forward,” Brown elaborated.</p>\n<p>That said, he stressed that ultimately only <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/lloyd-austin/\">Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin</a> can really make the call to undertake any review of specific mission sets, and institute changes.</p>\n<p>Brown said that one way OSD can, in effect, decide who does what mission set is via the budget approval process. “But I do think, because we have this new team” at OSD — led by Austin and Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks — “these are conversations we need to have as we go forward.”</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["Adm.

{"title": "DoD’s Own Bureaucracy Top Barrier To Winning Spectrum Back", "publish_time": "2021-03-22 21:21:19", "author": ["Brad D. Williams"], "content": "WASHINGTON: The Defense Department’s bureaucracy is the main barrier to implementing much-needed capabilities advancement in the\nelectromagnetic spectrum\n(EMS), even as adversaries “aggressively pursue” their own.\n“The consequences of getting this wrong could be disastrous,” HASC Subcommittee Ranking Member Rep. Elise Stefanik observed.\nThe failure to advance beyond “Cold War capabilities” has occurred despite three comprehensive DoD EMS strategies developed over the past eight years. The latest\nstrategy\n, finished just months ago, might face the same fate amid DoD bureaucratic morass unless something changes, warned the Government Accountability Office.\nThe fresh warnings arrive even as many recognize the urgency of this initiative and its importance to the entire military. There was unanimous agreement among experts and lawmakers that the EMS is “the most important environment to modern warfare,” as Hudson Institute Senior Fellow Bryan Clark put it. Yet, he said, EMS remains the “most unheralded warfighting space” within the US defense community.\nThe EMS enables a broad range of military capabilities, from\ncommunications\n,\nsignals intelligence\n, and\ncommand & control\nto\nsensing\n,\nnavigation\n, and\ntargeting\n. Despite its key role in\nintegrating battle networks\nand the fact everyone uses it every day, “In many ways,” Clark said, “it’s the forgotten domain because we can’t feel it like the land or experience it like we do cyberspace on the computer.”\nWilliam Conley, former director for electronic warfare in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, said the US has persistently failed to elevate EMS to a strategic level versus viewing it as a “capability to achieve tactical outcomes.”\nIn contrast to the US, Conley highlighted how China, in particular,\nhas succeeded in raising EMS to a strategic level\nwithin its military and has successfully blended electronic warfare, cyber, and space operations. “What [China has] done operationally is really pretty darn impressive,” Conley said. “The strategic question we’re faced with today is: How do we want to compete?”\nChina is not alone. In 2018, then-Special Operations Command chief Gen. Raymond Thomas said Russian activities in Syria were, “The most aggressive electronic warfare environment on the planet from our adversaries,” Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Jim Langevin recalled.\nWhile the EMS is an “existential capability” to enabling U.S. military success, as Stefanik observed, “Our dominance in this domain is no longer secure.”\nDespite the Defense Department developing comprehensive EMS strategies in 2013 and 2017, those were never fully implemented, according to testimony from Joseph Kirschbaum, director of GAO’s defense capabilities and management team.\n“[The 2013 and 2017 efforts] weren’t bad strategies,” Kirschbaum said, who was the primary author of the December 2020 report entitled\nEMS Operations: DoD Needs to Address Governance and Oversight Issues to Ensure Superiority\n. As noted in the report, Kirschbaum said DoD simply failed to implement the 2013 and 2017 strategies because of “bureaucratic and organizational hindrances.” He added, “GAO thinks this pattern [of bureaucratic hindrance] threatens potential success of the 2020 strategy.”\nThe expert testimony came during an unusually late Friday afternoon\nhearing\nbefore the HASC cyber, innovative technologies, and information systems subcommittee.\nThe struggle to advance EMS capabilities is particularly puzzling because there appears to be broad agreement among DoD officials, Congress, and experts on current problems and potential solutions, allowing for some nuances.\nThe pressing problem now, most agree, is that the US has allowed its EMS capabilities to languish since the Cold War ended, even as China and Russia were “aggressively pursuing mechanisms to deny the spectrum” to U.S. forces in order to “take apart” U.S. capabilities, Clark said. Clark was the primary author of\nWinning the Invisible War: Gaining an Enduring U.S. Advantage in the Electromagnetic Spectrum\n. We are now behind our rivals, Clark said.\nKirschbaum echoed Clark, observing that the US spent the past 20 years focused on the “war on the terror,” while China and Russia recognized an opportunity to gain an advantage and diligently expanded and improved their EMS capabilities.\nConley compared the American and Chinese military approaches to EMS. In 2015, China formed its Strategic Support Force — an equal mix of EMS, cyber, and space capabilities — and then put the force on equal footing with its army, navy, and air force. In contrast, Conley observed, the US has maintained electronic warfare and spectrum management merely as a capability to achieve tactical outcomes. Conley argued the US can no longer view EMS as merely tactical.\nThe US must instead elevate EMS to strategic relevance and give it equal footing with other domains. “EMS can actually create opportunities,” Conley said. One example is EMS battle management — which Conley characterized as “the dynamic reconfiguration of sensors and networks, as well as EMS attacks in real time.” Such an approach, Conley said, “may become the preferred method” to project US power.\nWhat’s needed to realize these goals then, aside from removing bureaucratic quagmire? Conley said the EMS strategy depends on innovation and tech development. But it can’t stop there. The US military must actually adopt, implement, and integrate innovations into tactics and operations. “Just inventing it is not adequate today,” Conley said.\nGiven adversaries’ advances, Clark said the US can’t afford to gradually grow EMS capabilities. Instead, a “leap ahead” is needed. To enable this leap, Clark argued the DoD should mount concepts and tech to regain the advantage in EMS. Doing so, Clark argued, entails pursuing an “important shift” toward capabilities like adaptability and maneuverability enabled by EMS.\nKirschbaum noted a good place to start would be basic management. Kirschbaum’s December 2020 report noted the past failures of DoD to develop a detailed implementation plan, provide leaders with authority to execute, and enact a process to review progress and assess results against intended outcomes. Clark agreed, adding we don’t need a “Pentagon staffing exercise that doesn’t result in real change.”\nEveryone agreed the DoD’s acquisition process and program management must be reformed. Conley called for a “dramatic departure” from legacy platform- and program-centric investment strategies.\nConley also pointed to one more factor at play: the economy. He recalled a 2019 study he performed comparing US-China GDP defense spending and research & development budgets using a purchase power comparison. At that time, China’s military spending was only 60 percent and its R&D spending only 80 percent of the US’s. But China is poised to keep growing its economy. Conley observed, “This is a very different strategic situation” than the US faced in the Cold War, during which the Soviet Union’s economy never approached parity with the US.\nConley offered six major recommendations the US could adopt to advance EMS capabilities, which include:\nIncentivize R&D at US commercial companies for defense applications;\nCreate an innovation framework for both traditional and non-traditional defense companies;\nCreate policies to share data across the national innovation base and supply chain;\nImprove competitiveness by sharing work produced on government contracts;\nEnsure “realistic” EMS environment and threat capability in budgeting, testing, and training;\nEstablish strategic EMS offensive function to create an “enduring advantage” in this space.\n“The greatest risk I see today is continuing to apply a legacy strategy to the strategic realities of today,” Conley said.\nMeanwhile, Kirschbaum noted that DoD will reach its self-imposed deadline for an EMS implementation plan for the 2020 comprehensive strategy in just under two weeks. He said he hasn’t seen any drafts or heard any updates from DoD yet, but given history and the stakes, many will be watching.\nIn Kirschbaum’s words: “It’s not an exaggeration to say the ability of our forces to successfully operate anywhere depends on success in EMS.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-104735\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/DRS-electromagnetic-spectrum.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"362\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/DRS-electromagnetic-spectrum.jpg 600w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/DRS-electromagnetic-spectrum-300x181.jpg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/DRS-electromagnetic-spectrum-495x300.jpg 495w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/DRS-electromagnetic-spectrum-210x127.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"/></p>\n<p>WASHINGTON:  The Defense Department’s bureaucracy is the main barrier to implementing much-needed capabilities advancement in the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/electronic-warfare/\">electromagnetic spectrum</a> (EMS), even as adversaries “aggressively pursue” their own.</p>\n<p>“The consequences of getting this wrong could be disastrous,” HASC Subcommittee Ranking Member Rep.

As noted in the report, Kirschbaum said DoD simply failed to implement the 2013 and 2017 strategies because of “bureaucratic and organizational hindrances.” He added, “GAO thinks this pattern [of bureaucratic hindrance] threatens potential success of the 2020 strategy.”</p>\n<p>The expert testimony came during an unusually late Friday afternoon <a href=\"https://armedservices.house.gov/hearings?ID=ECBAF30E-DBE5-4BC7-97D6-BCF0C10B6ADB\">hearing</a> before the HASC cyber, innovative technologies, and information systems subcommittee.</p>\n<p>The struggle to advance EMS capabilities is particularly puzzling because there appears to be broad agreement among DoD officials, Congress, and experts on current problems and potential solutions, allowing for some nuances.</p>\n<p>The pressing problem now, most agree, is that the US has allowed its EMS capabilities to languish since the Cold War ended, even as China and Russia were “aggressively pursuing mechanisms to deny the spectrum” to U.S. forces in order to “take apart” U.S. capabilities, Clark said. Clark was the primary author of <a href=\"https://csbaonline.org/research/publications/winning-the-invisible-war-gaining-an-enduring-u.s-advantage-in-the-electromagnetic-spectrum\">Winning the Invisible War: Gaining an Enduring U.S. Advantage in the Electromagnetic Spectrum</a>. We are now behind our rivals, Clark said.</p>\n<p>Kirschbaum echoed Clark, observing that the US spent the past 20 years focused on the “war on the terror,” while China and Russia recognized an opportunity to gain an advantage and diligently expanded and improved their EMS capabilities.</p>\n<p>Conley compared the American and Chinese military approaches to EMS. In 2015, China formed its Strategic Support Force — an equal mix of EMS, cyber, and space capabilities — and then put the force on equal footing with its army, navy, and air force. In contrast, Conley observed, the US has maintained electronic warfare and spectrum management merely as a capability to achieve tactical outcomes. Conley argued the US can no longer view EMS as merely tactical.</p>\n<p>The US must instead elevate EMS to strategic relevance and give it equal footing with other domains. “EMS can actually create opportunities,” Conley said. One example is EMS battle management — which Conley characterized as “the dynamic reconfiguration of sensors and networks, as well as EMS attacks in real time.” Such an approach, Conley said, “may become the preferred method” to project US power.</p>\n<p>What’s needed to realize these goals then, aside from removing bureaucratic quagmire? Conley said the EMS strategy depends on innovation and tech development. But it can’t stop there. The US military must actually adopt, implement, and integrate innovations into tactics and operations. “Just inventing it is not adequate today,” Conley said.</p>\n<p>Given adversaries’ advances, Clark said the US can’t afford to gradually grow EMS capabilities. Instead, a “leap ahead” is needed. To enable this leap, Clark argued the DoD should mount concepts and tech to regain the advantage in EMS. Doing so, Clark argued, entails pursuing an “important shift” toward capabilities like adaptability and maneuverability enabled by EMS.</p>\n<p>Kirschbaum noted a good place to start would be basic management. Kirschbaum’s December 2020 report noted the past failures of DoD to develop a detailed implementation plan, provide leaders with authority to execute, and enact a process to review progress and assess results against intended outcomes. Clark agreed, adding we don’t need a “Pentagon staffing exercise that doesn’t result in real change.”</p>\n<p>Everyone agreed the DoD’s acquisition process and program management must be reformed. Conley called for a “dramatic departure” from legacy platform- and program-centric investment strategies.</p>\n<p>Conley also pointed to one more factor at play: the economy. He recalled a 2019 study he performed comparing US-China GDP defense spending and research & development budgets using a purchase power comparison. At that time, China’s military spending was only 60 percent and its R&D spending only 80 percent of the US’s. But China is poised to keep growing its economy. Conley observed, “This is a very different strategic situation” than the US faced in the Cold War, during which the Soviet Union’s economy never approached parity with the US.</p>\n<p>Conley offered six major recommendations the US could adopt to advance EMS capabilities, which include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incentivize R&D at US commercial companies for defense applications;</li>\n<li>Create an innovation framework for both traditional and non-traditional defense companies;</li>\n<li>Create policies to share data across the national innovation base and supply chain;</li>\n<li>Improve competitiveness by sharing work produced on government contracts;</li>\n<li>Ensure “realistic” EMS environment and threat capability in budgeting, testing, and training;</li>\n<li>Establish strategic EMS offensive function to create an “enduring advantage” in this space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“The greatest risk I see today is continuing to apply a legacy strategy to the strategic realities of today,” Conley said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Kirschbaum noted that DoD will reach its self-imposed deadline for an EMS implementation plan for the 2020 comprehensive strategy in just under two weeks. He said he hasn’t seen any drafts or heard any updates from DoD yet, but given history and the stakes, many will be watching.</p>\n<p>In Kirschbaum’s words: “It’s not an exaggeration to say the ability of our forces to successfully operate anywhere depends on success in EMS.”</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["Bill Conley", "Bryan Clark", "China", "Defense Department", "DOD", "electromagnetic spectrum", "electromagnetic spectrum domain", "electronic warfare", "GAO", "great power competition", "overmatch", "Russia"], "categories": [], "img_data": [{"img_url": "https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/DRS-electromagnetic-spectrum.jpg", "img_describe": "", "img_name": "news/img_2021_07_21_60f798dc435cc49f1f88d771.png"}], "video_data": [], "url": "https://breakingdefense.com/2021/03/dods-own-bureaucracy-top-barrier-to-winning-spectrum-back/", "site_name": "breakingdefense", "insert_time": "2021-07-21 11:47:40"}

Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: “The principal challenge DoD faces is not a lack of innovation,”\nChristine Fox\ntold Congress Tuesday. “The tougher task is how to adopt all this new innovation more rapidly into DoD programs....We have lots of prototypes but what we need is sustainable programs.”\nFox, the former head of the Pentagon’s powerful Cost Assessment & Program Evaluation (CAPE) unit, was testifying to the\nfirst-ever hearing\nof House Armed Services’ newest subcommittee, Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and Information Systems. The topic of the day was innovation – but Fox and her fellow acquisition experts on the panel made clear that having lots of neat ideas was far from enough.\nThey offered lots of concrete suggestions on\nhow\nthe Defense Department could get innovative ideas across the “valley of death” that separates one-offs that look good in the lab from mass-produced weapon systems that work in the field.\nOne major past reform arguably made that harder: the division of the office for Acquisition, Technology, & Logistics into two separate undersecretariats, one for Research & Engineering and the other for Acquisition & Sustainment.\nHaving a separate R&E organization focused on innovation has real benefits, Fox said, but it also makes it harder to hand-off new technologies to the A&S side to turn them into mass-produced programs of record. On balance, she said, “perhaps it has exacerbated the key problem... the adoption of technology.”\nFormer DARPA director\nVictoria Coleman\nput it more bluntly: “Unfortunately, the split has created almost a fracture,” she said, in what should be an unbroken “continuum” from new idea to fielded product. That doesn’t mean we should re-merge R&E and A&S, she said, because there are very real differences in the skillset and organizational focus required to launch a new technology on the one hand and to mass-produce it on the other. But, she said, “it’s probably time we should review [and] see whether we should tweak aspects of it.”\nSoftware Over Hardware\nThe other recurring theme that stood out most strongly at the hearing? Focus on software first, hardware second.\nSubcommittee chairman Jim Langevin hit this point in his opening remarks, calling for the Pentagon to treat the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the sixth-generation fighters to come after “not as hardware platforms, but as flying computers, wrapped in an airplane.” (Breaking Defense readers will recall the constant struggles to update the F-35’s millions of lines of code, especially the crucial Mission Data Files).\nThat software-first approach should apply to warships and other big-ticket platforms as well, Fox added.\n“It’s all about the software,” agreed Coleman. And indeed the Pentagon has plenty of small, smart software shops such as the Air Force’s Kessel Run. But, she argued, what’s lacking is an institutional mechanism to systematically turn those software innovations into enduring programs.\n“We have wonderful examples like Kessel Run,” Coleman told the subcommittee. “What we don’t have today however is this concept of product management.” That, she explained, is the private-sector best practice in which coders get together every few weeks with the\nacquisition executives\nwho can give them guidance and resources to help turn their software into a usable product.\nToday, she said, “there’s no DoD component that does that function.”\nAnother Silicon Valley practice to borrow, Coleman said, is venture capital. Recent financial reforms, including at the interagency\nCommittee on Foreign Investment in the United States\n(CFIUS), successfully blocked many Chinese-backed venture capital firms from snatching up American innovations. But not enough American and allied capital has stepped up to fill the gap, leaving many start-ups desperate for funding the Pentagon could help provide.\n“Houston, we have a problem,” Coleman said. “We need to do something to [replace] the Chinese capital that left town.” She tried this on a small scale at DARPA, with a $35 million “national security seed fund” – “a drop in the bucket,” she acknowledged – but what’s necessary is a systematic DoD effort “to make trusted capital available to small businesses.”\nAnother way to move the necessary capital, added Hill and Intelligence Community veteran\nKlon Kitchen\n, might be to make software companies the prime contractors on major weapons programs, with hardware-focused firms as subcontractors. That’s the opposite of how it’s traditionally done, where hardware companies are the primes and software funding is tucked in various places across larger programs. Innovative firms don’t need lots of little investments, Kitchen said, but substantial contracts that can be scaled into enduring programs of record.\nTo get innovators on board, Kitchen added, “the Pentagon’s also going to have to reconsider its one-size-fits-all approach to intellectual property.” Innovative private-sector software firms live or die by their trade secrets, making them deeply reluctant to hand them over to the Defense Department to the extent traditional contracting arrangements often require.\nYou also need to help innovative firms – especially smaller ones – protect their IP against espionage, Fox said. The Pentagon should provide “a mechanism to plug in securely,” she argued, probably through some kind of high-security cloud computing architecture.\nOnce you’re properly focused on software over hardware, Fox argued, you can make your program much more flexible, adaptable, and easy to upgrade over time. You do that, she said, by making them “modular... from the very beginning.” This approach, known more formally as\nmodular open systems architecture\n, is basically the Lego approach to weapons system design.

{"title": "Trophy VPS For Stryker: Half The Weight, All The Protection?", "publish_time": "2021-03-09 19:13:30", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: A decade after the Trophy anti-missile system entered combat service on Israeli heavy tanks, manufacturer Rafael says it’s building an equally effective version at half the weight – for a customer it can’t disclose.\nRafael has previously said they’d gotten the weight of Trophy VPS down 40 percent below the original version, largely through clever design and replacing 2010-era electronics with much lighter modern versions. But now, land systems VP Michael Lurie told me, the US Army has independently streamlined the integration kit it uses to install Trophy. If you combine Rafael’s lighter VPS with the Army’s lighter integration kit, Lurie said, you cut weight in half.\nThat, the company says, makes the new Trophy Vehicle Protection System suitable for the 8×8 Stryker: the Army’s lightly armored 20-plus-ton vehicle that’s so far defeated attempts to install the kind of active protection systems used on 60-plus-ton Israel Merkavas,\nUS M1s\n, and (most recently) German\nLeopard IIs\n. After rejecting Artis’s\nIron Curtain\nsystem in earlier tests, the Army will\ntry out Rafael’s new Trophy Vehicle Protection System and rival Rheinmetall’s ADS\nlate this year.\nFor a Stryker, Lurie told me, “the whole thing together will be less than a ton.”\nGetting weight down is important, especially because active protection systems have to go on\ntop\nof the vehicle to get a clear view, both for the sensors – typically radar, but Trophy has added an electro-optical eye as well, and the interceptors – basically mini-missiles that shoot down incoming anti-tank missiles and rocket-propelled grenades. Smaller vehicles have less room on top and less weight to counterbalance any heavy objects installed on their roof. So what fits on a 60-plus-ton heavy tank like the M1 won’t fit on a Stryker a third as heavy.\nYet it’s lighter vehicles, with lighter armor, that most need active protection – since there are so many more kinds of anti-tank rounds that their armor cannot stop. In fact, even if an active defense system blows up an incoming warhead before it strikes the armor, there will be fragments and blast effects that might bounce off a full-size tank but still do substantial damage to a lighter vehicle.\nHow well does Stryker VPS handle this so-called “residual penetration”? “I can’t talk numbers on the phone,” Lurie said, “but the residual penetration is manageable with the Stryker.”\nWell, what does manageable mean? Will the crew survive but the vehicle be totaled? Or will the Stryker be able to shrug off whatever shrapnel gets past Trophy and continue with its mission?\n“It can protect a Stryker crew to a very, very high level,” Lurie told me. “The system protects the entire vehicle... front to end,” he said, so it should remain intact and drivable. (I didn’t ask specifically whether unarmored external components like sensors and radio antenna would survive intact, but those are notoriously vulnerable).\nOverall, he said, because the sensor quality, software, and interceptors are the same, Stryker would get “the same ... active protection” as a tank.\nWhat makes Lurie especially confident is that this Trophy VPS system is no longer a lab experiment or developmental product: It’s currently being built on a production assembly line. However, the client has asked Rafael not to disclose who they are or any other details. (My guess is it’s the Israeli Defense Force itself in a typically hypercautious mode, or perhaps a key Arab ally, but that’s pure speculation on my part).\nLurie says Rafael will continue to work on reducing Trophy’s weight, but he doesn’t expect any more major decreases. Instead it’s focusing more on upgrading Trophy’s capabilities – including making it compatible with the US Army’s forthcoming Modular Active Protection System. The Army wants MAPS to plug-and-play components from different vendors – a radar from this one, an interceptor from that one, a jammer from the other – so it can upgrade rapidly without being tied to any one contractor such as Rafael.\n“MAPS is a good approach, the right approach,” Lurie said.

However, Washington has yet to prove its commitment to help allies in the region defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity “with as much offensive as defensive weapons,” they add.\nThe State Department temporary halted\nweapons sales to the region back in January,\n, including\nF-35 fighter jets\nand\nMQ-9 Reaper drones\nto Abu Dhabi. That deal was approved by Washington as part of the Abraham Accords, as was the sale of precision-guided munitions to Riyadh.\nBack in September 2020, a joint peace deal was signed between Israel, the\nUnited Arab Emirates\n, Bahrain and the United States – known also as the Abraham Accords Peace Agreement – which includes a full normalization of diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\nToday, the administration plans to proceed with the sale of 50 stealthy fighters and 18 battle-ready drones to the UAE as it “continues reviewing details and consulting with Emirati officials” related to the use of the weapons, a State Department spokesperson said on April 14.\n“We will also continue to reinforce with the UAE and all recipients of US defense articles and services that US-origin defense equipment must be adequately secured and used in a manner that respects human rights and fully complies with the laws of armed conflict,” the statement added.\nFor Saudi Arabia, things look less clear.

Mike Rogers, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, stressed the fact that Russia is entering into a “disturbing number of arms sales and strategic agreements” with African nations, while China is using its Belt and Road Initiative to extract African natural resources.\n“The Chinese Communist Party is building its first overseas military base on the strategically import Horn of Africa. Alarmingly, it’s only a few miles away from our own base,” he said in a statement. “Given the increased role China and Russia are playing in Africa, and its geostrategic importance, it is imperative we continue to make investments there.”\nKnowing how the US has sold arms for more than 40 years in the Middle East, Saab’s suspicion is that there is no policy shift here, but rather a preference that is couched in political terms. “The industry is too powerful and the system is so robust and rigid that it really doesn’t allow for significant changes,” he said.\nThe decision to sell weapons to the UAE and Saudi Arabia is is also a clear message\nto Iran\nto prod it get to engage in talks over its nuclear file.\n“Tehran does not seem in a hurry to return to the negotiating table so we find president Biden tending to find a major political statement to present to the American public after Tehran’s delay in accepting any initiative from Washington,” Abdullah Al Jenaid, a Bahraini strategic expert and political researcher, said.

Gregory Harris, director of the Navy’s Air Warfare Division, said at a Navy League event this morning. The service will initially try for a 40/60 unmanned to manned aircraft mix, leading to the 60/40 ratio as time goes on.\nHarris’ comments support an estimate recently floated by Vice Adm. James Kilby, head of the Navy’s warfighting requirements and capabilities office, who told the House Armed Services Committee earlier this month he thinks the Navy “could get upwards of 40 percent of the aircraft in an air wing that are unmanned and then transition beyond that.”\nLast year, the Navy said it would close out the Super Hornet production line after 2021 to instead fund the Navy’s NGAD program, a move which puts some pressure on the service to get their plans in order.\n“We truly see NGAD as more than just a single aircraft,” Harris said. “We believe that as manned/unmanned teaming comes online, we will integrate those aspects” into a more refined acquisition plan.\n“As we look at it right now, the Next-Gen Air Dominance is a family of systems, which has as its centerpiece the F/A-XX – which may or may not be manned – platform.

These sources say the cyberattack succeeded in penetrating the facility’s physical and cyber protection layers installed after\nan earlier attack on the facility\n.\nIran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif threatened that his country will “take revenge” on Israel for the destructive cyberattack.\nHigh-confidence cyber threat intelligence and digital forensics evidence on Sunday’s incident remain sparse at the time of publication. The cyberattack is reminiscent of an\nattack on Natanz last year\nand\nStuxnet\n, a computer worm first discovered in 2010. Stuxnet was designed specifically to target the same Natanz facility hit in Sunday’s cyberattack. Stuxnet also destroyed Iranian centrifuges at the facility. Stuxnet is widely believed to have been a US-Israeli collaboration, but neither country has ever officially confirmed its role in that incident.\nDetails around the specifics of the power outage at Natanz in Sunday’s incident are unclear at the time of publication. It’s possible that Natanz’s power systems were directly targeted as part of the cyberattack, but it’s also possible the power outage occurred as the result of a reported explosion at Natanz. It’s unclear right now whether or not the cyberattack somehow played a role in the reported explosion, and if so, how.\nIf Natanz’s power systems were directly targeted as part of Sunday’s cyberattack, then industrial control systems (ICS) are a likely attack vector. ICS are inherent to many power systems, used to monitor and control physical components, such as switches and circuit breakers. Stuxnet targeted four zero-day vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Windows operating system and then Natanz’s ICS for centrifuges used to enrich uranium. Stuxnet did not specifically target the facility’s power system ICS.\nSources say that Natanz’s emergency backup power systems were impaired by some means in the attack — whether by cyber or physical is unclear right now. Such emergency backups are typically triggered to start automatically and immediately after primary system failure. To cause a total blackout like Sunday’s in a direct cyberattack on the power system, it would be necessary to successfully take down the facility’s primary generation system and at least one — perhaps multiple — emergency power backup systems simultaneously.\nThe attack occurred before U.S Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Israel. Austin, due to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu this afternoon, landed here Sunday and issued a standard statement about close relations between the US and Israel.\nThe subject of the damage was discussed during meetings the American defense secretary had here.\nIsraelis are deeply skeptical of what they often call the naiveté of the Biden administration in its handling of relations with the Iranian theocratic state. “The nice words that were said publicly after his meetings in Israel have not lowered the level of tension between Washington and Jerusalem on the Iranian issue,” an Israeli defense source said today. “Israel sees that the US is led by the nose by a regime that is cheating the world, to keep its gallop to the bomb.”\nThis view is shared by Israeli experts on Iran. The American policy is “way beyond naivety,” Mordechai Kedar, an expert on Iran, told BD. He added that, with a country like Iran, you have to talk with a “whip in hand” and not try to persuade it with “nice words.”\nGen. Aviv Kochavi, chief of staff of the\nIDF\n, said Sunday that the IDF’s “operations in the Middle East are not hidden from the eyes of the enemy. They are watching us, seeing our capabilities and weighing their steps with caution.” No Israeli official has publicly confirmed the attack.\nIran has implicated Israel, as it did after Stuxnet. Iranian nuclear officials called Sunday’s attack “nuclear terrorism.”\nThe US, of course, says it remains committed to Israel’s security and will work with the IDF to ensure it retains its qualitative military edge in the Middle East, Austin said Sunday, shortly after meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz. “Our bilateral relationship with Israel is central to regional stability,” Austin said.\nGantz said that Israel will work closely with the US to ensure that any new deal with Iran prevents a dangerous arms race in the region.\nAustin visited the home base of Israel’s F-35 stealth fighters, Nevatim Air Force Base, and was briefed on some very advanced Israeli developed weapon systems. As BD readers know, Israel is working on\nhighly classified additions t\no the F-35.\nOn Sunday, Iran’s Press TV said an electricity problem had caused an incident at the Natanz underground uranium enrichment site, without casualties or pollution.\nIsrael had no immediate official comment on the Natanz incident. The IDF’s top cyber operators, the 8200 unit, may well have been involved in any Israeli cyber strike.\nThe news of Sunday’s incident at Natanz comes as the major Western powers seek to return to the nuclear deal from which the US unilaterally withdrew in 2018.\nAccording to Iranian television, the new “IR-9” centrifuge has the ability to separate uranium isotopes faster than current devices, which means more uranium enrichment.\nAccording to the announcement, the output of the IR-9 centrifuge exceeds 50 times the capacity of the old IR-1.\nMore details may emerge about the cyberattack next week, when Kochavi and Mossad chief Yossi Cohen arrive in Washington.\nMeanwhile, an Iranian ship, the MV Saviz,\nmay have been attacked by Israel last week\n. The timing of the attack on the Iranian Revolutionary Guards ship cannot be separated from the date of the resumption of nuclear talks between representatives of the United States and Iran, says Yoni Ben Menachem, an expert on Iran in the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. “It is likely that Israel, if it did carry out the operation, also wanted to send a message to the Biden administration that the situation is very tense and that a return to the nuclear deal and the lifting of sanctions on Iran could strengthen the military option.”\nIsraeli defense sources say Iran may retaliate using ballistic missiles against Israeli targets or an attack by the Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Iranian proxy equipped with 140,000 rockets.\nThe apparent attacks on the Iranian spy ship and Natanz have created a “very explosive” situation, said a defense source here. The problem is knowing where the explosion will occur.\nThe IDF, sources here say, is on high alert, with all Israeli intelligence sensors operating full force to detect any imminent Iranian action.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-149570\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Natanz-Iranian-nuclear-centrifuges.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Natanz-Iranian-nuclear-centrifuges.jpeg 1000w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Natanz-Iranian-nuclear-centrifuges-300x180.jpeg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Natanz-Iranian-nuclear-centrifuges-768x461.jpeg 768w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Natanz-Iranian-nuclear-centrifuges-210x126.jpeg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"/></p>\n<p>TEL AVIV: Israel appears to have launched a successful cyberattack on the Iranian nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, causing a blackout at the facility on Sunday and resulting in heavy damage to centrifuges, according to Middle Eastern sources.

The company is building its own Cubesats to carry its Laser Interconnect and Networking Communication System (LINCS) payload, Bucci said.\nSDA plans to launch four experimental satellites\nin June\n— the two LINCS sats, and two satellites (called Able and Baker) built by Astro Digital, and carrying the SA Photonics payloads.\nThe SA Photonics payloads were designed as part\nDARPA’s Blackjack program,\nand are known collectively as the\nMandrake 2\nexperimental satellites.\n“These OISL [Optical Inter-Satellite Links] terminals are early versions of our CrossBeamTM system that is being developed to support DARPA Blackjack and SDA Tranche 0 applications,” Dave Pechner, chief technical officer at SA Photonics said in an email. “The goal of the Mandrake-2 mission is to demonstrate OISL crosslink capabilities as well as space-to-ground links,” he added.\nDerek Tournear, SDA director, has stressed that\nOISLs are a key enabler\nfor the Transport Layer of the agency’s seven-layered\nNational Defense Space Architecture.\nThe Transport Layer is the planned constellation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites,\nintended by former Defense Secretary Mark Esper to serve as the “backbone” SATCOM\ninfrastructure for DoD’s emerging\nJoint All Domain Command and Control (JADC3)\nstrategy.\nTournear “has highlighted OISLs as one of the top risk areas SDA is looking to address as we move rapidly toward delivery of Tranche 0 and beyond,” an SDA official reiterated. (\nTranche 0 is the first wave of SDA demo sats\nto be launched next year.). “SDA is partnered with DARPA on the Mandrake 2 experiment and with General Atomics on LINCS. These parallel risk reduction efforts enhance SDA’s ability to burn down risk in this area and provide a backup if one of the efforts is delayed or fails for any reason.”\nOptical heads that combine low cost, size, weight, and power demands “are an emerging capability, with multiple vendors offering a variety of products,” said a DARPA spokesperson. “DARPA is interested in maturing as many of these offerings as possible to ensure our transition partners have choices for their systems.”\nLaser links are key to making LEO communications satellites useful, according to industry experts. The laws of physics mean that satellites in LEO are visible over the horizon, from any given point on the surface, for some 10 minutes max. Keeping in contact requires either too many ground stations to make business sense, or satellites that can communicate with each other so as to bounce data to a sister satellite that is over a ground station at any one time.\nIn addition, laser links also are being explored by a number of nations for communicating with satellites, robots and eventually people exploring the Moon and Mars and beyond, because laser wavelengths have the capacity to transmit information at higher data rates than radio waves. That speed in communication is also a boon for communicating from LEO to the ground.\n“The Mandrake-2 terminals will provide 100 Mbps data rates up to 5,000 km link distance,” Pechner said — a speed SA Photonics hopes to increase to 2.5 Gbps in later versions.\nGeneral Atomics touts LINCS on its website as being able to demo “data rates up to 5GB a second at ranges up to 2500 km.”\nBucci explained that there are three key challenges to OISL capability in LEO: payload size; detecting and tracking optical receivers on board satellites; and preventing distortion of the laser beam by the atmosphere when linking to ground stations.\nBoth DARPA and SDA are counting on being able to do a lot with very small satellites, in order to keep the costs of LEO constellations with hundreds of satellites down. Tournear has said he expects an individual SDA satellite to run\nin the “tens of millions,”\nas opposed to the billion-dollar price tags for most large DoD communications satellites.\n“One of the obstacles was producing something that could fit into a small package, ” Bucci said. “Getting both a data collector payload on board and a laser communication payload on board, and capable processing for that data collector payload, and communication processing, as well as the attitude and control, the power and control hardware — getting that all on a small package is an extremely difficult job. To get 10 pounds of stuff in a five pound bag, there’s always a challenge, right?”\nHe explained that ensuring the laser beam can reliably do the acquisition, tracking and pointing between two satellites — separated by thousands of kilometers and moving at the speed of a bullet — also is a tough technical feat. Especially, he added, because the beams themselves are quite narrow.\nFinally, getting a laser beam to the ground from a satellite (and vice versa) is a well-know physics problem, and one that DoD has struggled with for years. Bucci said that General Atomics is using an equally well-known solution, adaptive optics, to refocus the beam on its way to a ground station. Indeed, the company has a good deal of experience in developing adaptive optics for a variety of customers, he noted.\nAdaptive optics involves using reformable mirrors, and has long been the subject of research by\nthe Missile Defense Agency for killing ballistic and cruise missiles.\n(Adaptive optics also has been the subject of research by the Air Force in the past for developing ground- and air-based anti-satellite weapons.)\nBucci explained that in addition, adaptive optics will enable the satellites to increase the bandwidth of transmissions to the ground — meaning more data can be jetted to the user in that short seven to 10 minute window the satellite is able to link to the ground station.\nHowever, DoD and industry experts note that in the end, optical data links to ground stations likely will never be able to fully outwit Mother Nature, because the moisture in cloud cover will scatter and block visible light.

{"title": "Navy Makes $554M Commitment To Second Frigate, USS Congress", "publish_time": "2021-05-21 15:30:38", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "Constellation-class frigate\nWASHINGTON: A week before rolling out its 2022 budget plan, the Navy doubled down on its new Constellation-class frigates with a $553.9 million commitment to build the second ship in the class, the USS Congress. The full price of the frigate — counting not just payments to the shipyard but all the government-furnished high-tech weapons systems — is estimated at $1.1 billion, with delivery to the Navy in 2026, while the third and subsequent ships in the class are supposed to drop to around $940 million.\nThe ships are named after two of the Navy’s original six sail-powered frigates ordered in 1794.\nThe award for Congress is not unexpected. The Navy’s contract with shipbuilder Fincantieri Marinette Marine has options for 10 ships, and the service aims to buy at least 20. But it’s still a very public commitment to the class at a time when all eyes in Washington are turning to the budget. The fiscal year 2022 plan is expected to be relatively good news for Navy shipbuilding, with Biden Administration budget cuts falling more heavily on the other services, driven by the administration’s focus on competing with China in the West Pacific.\n\n\nThe Navy has struggled, however, to deliver new ship classes. That includes the supercarrier USS Ford, which headed into trials with some of its weapons elevators unfinished, and the two classes of small, high-speed Littoral Combat Ship, whose minesweeping and anti-submarine modules lagged for years.\nThe problem with those programs was, at least in part, how many new technologies they tried to pioneer at once, from electromagnetic aircraft-launch catapults on Ford to a host of drones on LCS. So for the Constellation class, the Navy is aiming to combine proven components:\n\nThe hull is derived from Fincantieri’s FREMM frigates already in service with the French and Italian navies.\n\n\nFrance’s first two FREMM frigates built by Italy’s Fincantieri.\nThe computerized combat system, Aegis Baseline 10, is the same upgrade to the time-honored Aegis system that will go on Navy destroyers, enabling the frigates to defend both themselves and nearby vessels from air and missile attack.\nThe multipurpose missile launchers are the same Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) long standard on cruisers and destroyers. That means the frigates can use the many different weapons – both offensive and missile-defense – already developed and in development for VLS.\nThe main sensor system, the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR), is also going on carriers and amphibious warships, and it’s derived from the SPY-6 going on the newest Arleigh Burke destroyers.\n\nThe goal is a warship that shares many of the capabilities of the Navy’s workhorse destroyers, the Arleigh Burke class, but at a smaller and cheaper scale. (A destroyer costs over $2 billion). At the same time, the frigate is larger, more powerful, and harder to sink than LCS, which was originally envisioned for auxiliary roles like minesweeping and sub-hunting, not fleet-to-fleet combat. To that end, Navy Sea Systems Command spokesman Alan Baribeau told me, the frigate “will provide increased range, endurance and survivability… and added capability in the Electronic Warfare/Information Operations (EW/IO) area that LCS does not currently possess.”\n\n\n \n\nAlthough the Navy won’t confirm this, the frigate is also expected to be slower than LCS, whose 40-plus knot speed drove major design compromises and propulsion problems without ever meeting a clear tactical need.", "content_html": "<div><div class=\"entry\">\n<div id=\"attachment_157736\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-157736\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-157736\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/FFG-62-Fwd-Stbd-Iso-1024x474.jpeg\" alt=\"Fincantieri Marinette Marine graphic\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/FFG-62-Fwd-Stbd-Iso-1024x474.jpeg 1024w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/FFG-62-Fwd-Stbd-Iso-300x139.jpeg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/FFG-62-Fwd-Stbd-Iso-768x356.jpeg 768w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/FFG-62-Fwd-Stbd-Iso-210x97.jpeg 210w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/FFG-62-Fwd-Stbd-Iso.jpeg 1876w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-157736\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Constellation-class frigate</p></div>\n<p>WASHINGTON: A week before rolling out its<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/2022-budget/\"> 2022 budget plan</a>, the Navy doubled down on its <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/04/fincantieri-wins-bigger-place-in-navy-plans-takes-frigate-contract/\">new <em>Constellation</em>-class frigates</a> with a $553.9 million commitment to build the second ship in the class, the USS <em><a href=\"https://www.nvr.navy.mil/SHIPDETAILS/SHIPSDETAIL_FFG_63.HTML\">Congress</a></em>.

Gen. Eric Fick.\nHowever, officially passing through ‘milestone C’ into full-rate production may not matter that much, Fick told the annual McAleese defense conference today.\nIt will do little to change either how fast planes are already being built or how deeply involved the JPO and acquisition leaders at DoD and the services will remain in managing the sprawling, $400 billion procurement effort.\n“We are effectively at full rate production today,” he said. “Milestone C used to kind of be a departure from the close management of OSD and the services [but] I don’t see us getting away from that. So, really, for me, I don’t sense that the lack of that milestone is doing anything other than providing a launching point for criticism of the program. So for that reason perhaps alone, I would love to get past [it].”\nThe ability to properly test the F-35 fleet via DoD’s\nJoint Simulation Environment (JSE)\nhas been the key roadblock to the program moving to full-rate production, Fick said. The Director of Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) must certify that the fighters can pass 64 different test ‘missions’ using the JSE before certifying that the program can pass move to full-rate production.\n“Having stood up last year, and in previous years and committed to timelines and gotten burned by them,” he said, the JPO asked outside experts (including from Carnegie Melon and John Hopkins universities): “Are we asking this team to do something that’s it’s not even possible to do?”\nAfter being briefed yesterday on the expert study’s summary findings, he said the answer appears to be no: “We’re not asking for something that’s impossible.”\nHowever, the findings also made it clear that the JPO doesn’t yet have the insight needed to validate that the aircraft can exchange data and work seamlessly with the JSE. “It’s the validation verification piece that I’m struggling with a little bit,” he said, adding that he needs more certainty “before I commit.”\nHill Action?\nSpeaking of criticism, House Armed Services Committee (HASC) Chair Adam Smith, again blasted the program today as a poster child for failed DoD acquisition, especially related to software-heavy modern weapon systems.\n“The F-35 is not the only problem. And I do understand how important the platform is,” Smith told the McAleese conference. “But the amount of money over budget it is, the amount of time it has taken, the sustainment costs, the problems with the engine — it is indicative of 20 years of too many mistakes. Too many mistakes on programs that wound up being too expensive and didn’t deliver the capability that they said they were going to deliver.”\nSmith and other key HASC Democrats\nhave suggested that Congress might slow or cut planned production in the 2022 budgeting process until DoD gets a better handle on the program’s many woes — especially the\naircraft’s astronomical operating costs.\nHowever, they are already facing pushback from the program’s many supporters in Congress. Members of the House F-35 caucus\npenned an April 28 letter\nto Smith and Rep. Betty McCollum, who chairs the House Appropriations defense subcommittee, urging DoD to\nincrease\nproduction.\nDoD asked for 79 planes in its 2021 budget request, including 48 for the Air Force — but Congress added 17 (a formula that has been repeated over a number of years now) to bring the total to 96. The Biden administration is sticking to its predecessor’s plan to ask for $11 billion in 2022 to buy 75 planes; 48 for the Air Force,\nreports colleague Tony Capaccio today.\nRep. Anthony Brown, one of the 132 signatories from the caucus, yesterday acknowledged the programs numerous challenges from JSE integration to sustainment costs to the\nlong-troubled maintenance software\n, but still urged continued support.\n“I would acknowledge that it is the most expensive procurement, and likely the most expensive sustainment program in the history of the department, there’s no doubt about it,” Brown admitted. He also expressed concern that the full-rate production delay actually could cost DoD the technology advantage the aircraft now represents.\nBut, Brown argued, the F-35’s battlefield performance is proving its value as a much-needed fifth-generation fighter for a future fight against China.\n“What I would say to my colleagues is, we’ve made a big investment. It’s a capability that we dramatically need, certainly as we’re pivoting to the Indo-Pacific,” he said. “We are making progress. There is frustration around the pace of progress, but we are going to get there.”\nTransition To ODIN\nAs Brown mentioned, Lockheed Martin’s\nALIS, the troubled proprietary maintenance and planning software,\ncontinues to contribute to high costs and dismal readiness rates. But Fick said the pain is easing.\nHowever, he declined to commit to any new deadline for transitioning from ALIS to the new government-designed and owned system known as\nODIN, (Operational Integrated Data Network)\n— explaining the JPO has decided to take some time to “recalibrate our plan.”\nWhile Air Force coders and former head of acquisition Will Roper were enthusiastic about ODIN being created at the speed of Silicon Valley, it turns out they were too ambitious. Fick said the JPO’s outside advisors on software development told the JPO that coders simply couldn’t work fast enough to build ODIN as quickly as hoped.\nAt the same time, fixes to ALIS have yielded better results than expected, he explained.\nFurther, initial hardware designed to run ALIS upgrades and support future ODIN software “is actually solving some of our issues and some of our crises, and we’ll be able to roll out a more detailed plan, I’m going to guess, within the next six to nine months.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-125651\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Dramatic-f-35-on-ground-1024x623.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Dramatic-f-35-on-ground-1024x623.jpg 1024w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Dramatic-f-35-on-ground-300x182.jpg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Dramatic-f-35-on-ground-768x467.jpg 768w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Dramatic-f-35-on-ground-495x300.jpg 495w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Dramatic-f-35-on-ground-210x128.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"/>WASHINGTON: The F-35 Joint Program Office is still evaluating when the fighter will formally clear its 20-year development phase after a new expert study of testing requirements, says JPO Director Lt.

{"title": "Bullets, Beans & Data: The New Army Materiel Command EXCLUSIVE", "publish_time": "2020-12-15 17:33:01", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: When the Army first\nfielded heavy-duty 3D printers\nto its\ncombat divisions\n, maintenance troops were excited by the potential to print their own spare parts in the field, on demand, without waiting days, weeks, or months. But they quickly ran into a problem. Before you can print out a part, you need a detailed 3D model of it, and for most parts,\nthose models don’t exist\n.\nSo\nGen. Ed Daly\n, the\nnew chief of Army Materiel Command\n, is pushing to get 5,000 parts on file in the next 12 months – and that’s just the beginning. The crucial element in all this — lots and lots of accurate, well-organized, and easily accessible data.\nIn the 20\nth\ncentury, America’s military might depended on our ability to move millions of tons of physical\nstuff\naround the world. In the 21\nst\ncentury, it might depend just as much on our ability to move 1s and 0s.\nLook at the Army’s experience with 3D printing. “When I was the\nChief of Ord\n, I was very frustrated” about the new 3D printers in the Army’s deployable machine shops, Daly told me in an hour-long interview. “That was a great piece of equipment to be fielded, but I felt like units at the tactical level, the allied trades personnel in maintenance companies, were being constrained because they didn’t have access to a data repository.\n“Unless they built the 3D printer design\nthemselves\nit was very, very difficult,” he said. “We’re finally starting to realize that that equipment is only as good as the enabling ... digital thread. You need... a data repository of all the 3D drawings,” Daly said.\nDaly’s immediate goal? “It’s a race to 5,000,” he told me. “I want to get to 5,000 [parts] by the end of calendar year...5,000\nNational Stock Numbers\nin the data repository that can be used at the tactical edge.”\nThat requires buying data rights from contractors, creating 3D drawings of old parts where none now exist, and\neven taking apart entire helicopters\nand armored vehicles to analyze every component. Then the Army has to take all that data, clean it up, put it in standard formats, and upgrade its global communications networks to make it accessible even to combat units deployed in war zones overseas.\n“It’s just not in [stateside]\ndepots, arsenals, and ammunition plants\n,” Day emphasized. “Our vision within the Army is really to take advanced manufacturing...all the way to the tactical points of contact.”\nFrom ‘Iron Mountains’ To Digital Logistics\nThe sweet spot for 3D printing is churning out parts that meet three criteria. They’re hard to get through normal channels, often because the original manufacturer went out of business; they’re not essential to safe operation of equipment, because that would require time-consuming testing and certification; and they’re simple enough for maintenance troops or depot workers to create their own digital designs.\nBut the Army has much bigger ambitions. Cargo ships, planes, helicopters, truck convoys, and supply depots are increasingly vulnerable to attack by precision-guided missiles. The Joint Staff has charged the Army — which provides supplies to all the services, not just its own units — to develop a new concept for “\njoint logistics under attack\n,” a vital part of future\nAll-Domain Operations.\nAnd the service’s own official concept for future conflict, Multi-Domain Operations, says individual combat brigades must be able to operate up to seven days without stopping for resupply.\nThat goal is impossible with the traditional logistical system, which relies on moving thousands of tons of fuel, ammunition, rations, and spare parts around the world and\nbuilding up “iron mountains” of stockpiles\n. So – while logistics isn’t officially one of the Army’s Big Six modernization priorities – the Army is investing in a host of technologies to reduce its dependence on long and vulnerable supply lines:\nelectric-drive vehicles\nand\nmobile nuclear reactors\nto reduce fuel demand;\nunmanned supply drones and trucks, to reduce the number of personnel deployed and at risk;\nAI-driven predictive maintenance, to reduce the amount of time equipment spends out of service;\ndata analytics for determining exactly what supplies and spares a unit needs, to reduce just-in-case stockpiling;\nand\n3D printing\n, to reduce the number of different spare parts a unit has to schlep along with it in case something breaks down.\n“We’re really going after some big game changers ... not just incremental change,” Daly told me. “That is going to change the complexion of sustainment on the battlefield.”\nToday, logisticians make do with a bewildering variety of different specialized systems to track, order, and manage different kinds of supplies.\n“We’ve got\nGCSS-Army\n,” Daly said. “We’ve got\nGFEBS\n,\nAESIP\n... and then we have about 500-plus other legacy systems that are out there.” Only some of these, like\nCAISI and CSS VSAT\n, are designed to be easily deployed with combat units – but even those frontline logistics systems run on different networks, using different hardware and software, than the tactical command-and-control systems used to coordinate combat operations.\nThe goal is to modernize this alphabet soup of systems so they form one coherent meta-network extending from AMC HQ and maintenance depots in the United States all the way to frontline troops. “What we have done in the past is that the sustainment has always been separate from the tactical network,” Daly told me. “Now, it’s going to be integrated.”\nShow Me The Data\nBuilding an\nintegrated global network\nis itself a tremendous technical challenge. So is securing it against cyber attack, as our readers know from our coverage of All Domain Operations (ADO). But the network just provides\naccess\nto the data. To make something like 3D printing work, you also have to\ncollect\nthe data.\n“We have two systems right now,” Daly told me. “Windshield is the data repository for one, which is not very user-friendly, but that’s what our engineers use. And the other system is called Raptor, and that’s more user-friendly, but it is very immature.” Army Materiel Command is now studying options to move beyond these separate systems to an “overarching digital thread... so that anybody, anywhere in the world, can pull from that data repository,” Daly said. “That should be in place by early summer.”\nOnce you set up a data repository, how do you fill it? The Army needs to pull from two directions, Daly said: It has to go back into its existing inventory of parts, which often means creating digital 3D blueprints where none exists, and it has to go forward with its new weapons programs, ensuring that those contracts include 3D data packages from the start.\n“For the legacy systems... unfortunately, for about 99 percent of our stock numbers, we don’t have 3D computer-aided design instructions,” Daly told me. “We’ve got to negotiate the tech data. We’ve got to do first-article testing. [We have to] have the certification that, if we 3D print it, it’s safe to put on a vehicle or system.”\n“That’s going to take time,” he said. “That’s that race to 5,000.”\nBut “over time, the next 10, 15 years, we’ll be exponentially better at having this repository,” Daly said. Already, Army Materiel Command’s subordinate\nLife Cycle Management Commands\n– AMCOM for aviation & missiles, CECOM for communications & electronics, TACOM for tanks & other vehicles, JMC for munitions – are working with Army Futures Command, which leads modernization, and the acquisition Program Executive Officers, who actually buy everything for the Army. Together, they’re thrashing out the complex technical, contractual, and legal details of how to get the\nintellectual property rights\nand technical data packages to allow 3D printing for every new weapons system.\n“How do we buy 3D drawings?” Daly asked. “How do we buy a\nportion\nof the tech data?”\n“We don’t necessarily have to buy\nall\nthe tech data,” he emphasized. “We just have to buy the\nright\ntech data and get the\nright\n3D drawings.”\n[\nClick here to read Part II of our exclusive interview with Gen.

{"title": "AFRL’s Golden Horde ‘Swarms’ Would Increase Fighter Lethality", "publish_time": "2021-01-08 21:07:06", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: The Air Force Research Laboratory’s prototype ‘swarming’ munitions failed to hit their targets in their first flight demo, but experts see the potential for networked, autonomous munitions to eventually equip America’s entire fighter fleet.\nThe new munitions being designed under AFRL’s\nGolden Horde\nproject use data links to communicate, chose targets (based on pre-programmed algorithms) and then coordinate strikes against an array of targets, independently from the human pilot.\n“Salvos of collaborative weapons that can share target information and autonomously coordinate their strikes after launch could help maximize target damage and compensate for weapons lost in flight due to enemy defenses or other factors,” explains Mark Gunzinger, director of future programs at the Mitchell Institute. “This would enable the U.S. military to use smaller salvos of weapons to achieve desired effects in the battlespace compared to larger salvos of non-collaborative weapons that must be independently targeted/retargeted by human operators.”\nThe first Golden Horde flight demo was held Dec. 15 but announced yesterday. The project is designed to build data links that enable semi-autonomous weapons to ‘swarm’ a target. The effort involves two different weapon systems —\nthe Collaborative Small Diameter Bomb I (CSDB-I) and the Collaborative Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (CMALD)\n— with a “capstone” test expected this fall.\nThe demo involved the release of two CSDBs from an F-16, the AFRL release said. CSDBs, lab explained, are “Small Diameter Bombs that have been modified with a collaborative autonomy payload” developed by AFRL and Scientific Applications & Research Associates (SARA).\n“I’m very pleased with results of this first test,” Steven Stockbridge, the Golden Horde principal investigator, said in the AFRL release. “The team saw good performance from the networked collaborative sub-systems and understand the root cause of the weapons not impacting the desired targets. We anticipate readiness for the next flight test.” Two more CSDB flight tests are planned for early 2021, increasing the number of collaborative weapons in each demonstration to four, the release added.\nAFRL explained that during the demo the “CSDBs quickly established communication with each other and their seekers detected a GPS jammer” and using pre-defined rules of engagement pre-loaded into the system, “determined that the jammer was not the highest priority target. The weapons then collaborated to identify the two highest priority targets. However, due to an improper weapon software load, the collaboration guidance commands were not sent to the weapon navigation system. Without the updated target locations, the weapons impacted a fail-safe target location.”\nBoeing builds the venerable GBU-39B\nSmall Diameter Bomb\n, which entered service in 2005 and now equips the F-15E Strike Eagle, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the F-22 Raptor and the AC-130W. In September 2020, the company won a $2.2 billion Lot 15 production contract comprising some 7,800 bombs for the Air Force and foreign customers. A Boeing spokesperson confirmed that the company is a subcontractor on Golden Horde — which is one of AFRL’s\nhigh-priority, rapid-prototype Vanguard programs\n— but referred all questions to AFRL.\nThe CSDB modifications to the GBU-39B include “a home-on-GPS-jam seeker that gathers information about the battlespace, a software-defined radio for communication between weapons and a processor preloaded with collaborative algorithms,” according to the AFRL release.\n“The collaborative algorithms use a dynamic approach called play calling, similar to a quarterback calling a play in football,” the release elaborates. “A ‘play’ is an established behavior that groups of collaborative weapons, or swarms, can enable (or disable) when they meet certain predefined conditions. Weapons that use this technology are semi-autonomous since they abide by pre-defined Rules of Engagement and only execute based on an approved list of plays.”\n“The Golden Horde demonstration with the Small Diameter Bomb flights is an important step on the path to Networked Collaborative Weapon systems. Completion of this first mission sets the stage for further development and transition to the warfighter,” Chris Ristich, director of AFRL’s Transformational Capabilities Office, said.\nWhile the test used an F-16, there is obvious potential for CSBDs to be carried by a wide array of other fighters.\nCol. Garry Haase, director of the AFRL Munitions Directorate explained in the release: “This successful Golden Horde demonstration builds the foundation for integrating this technology into a variety of other weapon systems, which will help the U.S. maintain a technological advantage over our adversaries.” For the moment, however, Haase said there aren’t any plans to transition the autonomy package onto the current arsenal of SDBs.\nGunzinger said he hopes that the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will be given “priority” for future mating with the CSDB, when and if its development is successful.\n“Short-range standoff weapons like the SDB I and SDB II allow aircraft to strike targets without overflying defenses that may be concentrated around target areas. This improves the survivability of all aircraft that employ them, including 5th generation stealth aircraft,” he said. (\nSDB II, the GBU-53 StormBreaker\n, is built by Raytheon.)\n“The Air Force has been quite open about the need to develop a new generation of weapons that are smaller and better suited for stealth aircraft operations (need 5th gen weapons for 5th gen aircraft),” he added.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The Air Force Research Laboratory’s prototype ‘swarming’ munitions failed to hit their targets in their first flight demo, but experts see the potential for networked, autonomous munitions to eventually equip America’s entire fighter fleet.</p>\n<p>The new munitions being designed under AFRL’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/golden-horde/\">Golden Horde</a> project use data links to communicate, chose targets (based on pre-programmed algorithms) and then coordinate strikes against an array of targets, independently from the human pilot.</p>\n<p>“Salvos of collaborative weapons that can share target information and autonomously coordinate their strikes after launch could help maximize target damage and compensate for weapons lost in flight due to enemy defenses or other factors,” explains Mark Gunzinger, director of future programs at the Mitchell Institute. “This would enable the U.S. military to use smaller salvos of weapons to achieve desired effects in the battlespace compared to larger salvos of non-collaborative weapons that must be independently targeted/retargeted by human operators.”</p>\n\n<p>The first Golden Horde flight demo was held Dec. 15 but announced yesterday.

CSDBs, lab explained, are “Small Diameter Bombs that have been modified with a collaborative autonomy payload” developed by AFRL and Scientific Applications & Research Associates (SARA).</p>\n\n<p>“I’m very pleased with results of this first test,” Steven Stockbridge, the Golden Horde principal investigator, said in the AFRL release. “The team saw good performance from the networked collaborative sub-systems and understand the root cause of the weapons not impacting the desired targets. We anticipate readiness for the next flight test.” Two more CSDB flight tests are planned for early 2021, increasing the number of collaborative weapons in each demonstration to four, the release added.</p>\n<p>AFRL explained that during the demo the “CSDBs quickly established communication with each other and their seekers detected a GPS jammer” and using pre-defined rules of engagement pre-loaded into the system, “determined that the jammer was not the highest priority target. The weapons then collaborated to identify the two highest priority targets. However, due to an improper weapon software load, the collaboration guidance commands were not sent to the weapon navigation system. Without the updated target locations, the weapons impacted a fail-safe target location.”</p>\n\n \n<p>Boeing builds the venerable GBU-39B <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/small-diameter-bomb/\">Small Diameter Bomb</a>, which entered service in 2005 and now equips the F-15E Strike Eagle, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the F-22 Raptor and the AC-130W. In September 2020, the company won a $2.2 billion Lot 15 production contract comprising some 7,800 bombs for the Air Force and foreign customers. A Boeing spokesperson confirmed that the company is a subcontractor on Golden Horde — which is one of AFRL’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/vanguard/\">high-priority, rapid-prototype Vanguard programs</a> — but referred all questions to AFRL.</p>\n<p>The CSDB modifications to the GBU-39B include “a home-on-GPS-jam seeker that gathers information about the battlespace, a software-defined radio for communication between weapons and a processor preloaded with collaborative algorithms,” according to the AFRL release.</p>\n<p>“The collaborative algorithms use a dynamic approach called play calling, similar to a quarterback calling a play in football,” the release elaborates. “A ‘play’ is an established behavior that groups of collaborative weapons, or swarms, can enable (or disable) when they meet certain predefined conditions. Weapons that use this technology are semi-autonomous since they abide by pre-defined Rules of Engagement and only execute based on an approved list of plays.”</p>\n<p>“The Golden Horde demonstration with the Small Diameter Bomb flights is an important step on the path to Networked Collaborative Weapon systems. Completion of this first mission sets the stage for further development and transition to the warfighter,” Chris Ristich, director of AFRL’s Transformational Capabilities Office, said.</p>\n<p>While the test used an F-16, there is obvious potential for CSBDs to be carried by a wide array of other fighters.</p>\n<p>Col. Garry Haase, director of the AFRL Munitions Directorate explained in the release: “This successful Golden Horde demonstration builds the foundation for integrating this technology into a variety of other weapon systems, which will help the U.S. maintain a technological advantage over our adversaries.” For the moment, however, Haase said there aren’t any plans to transition the autonomy package onto the current arsenal of SDBs.</p>\n<p>Gunzinger said he hopes that the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will be given “priority” for future mating with the CSDB, when and if its development is successful.</p>\n<p>“Short-range standoff weapons like the SDB I and SDB II allow aircraft to strike targets without overflying defenses that may be concentrated around target areas. This improves the survivability of all aircraft that employ them, including 5th generation stealth aircraft,” he said. (<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/small-diameter-bomb-2/\">SDB II, the GBU-53 StormBreaker</a>, is built by Raytheon.)</p>\n<p>“The Air Force has been quite open about the need to develop a new generation of weapons that are smaller and better suited for stealth aircraft operations (need 5th gen weapons for 5th gen aircraft),” he added.</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["air force", "Air Force Research Laboratory AFRL", "autonomy", "Boeing", "f-35 joint strike fighter", "GBU-39B", "Golden Horde", "Mark Gunzinger", "Mitchell Institute", "Raytheon", "Small Diameter Bomb", "Small Diameter Bomb 2"], "categories": [], "img_data": [{"img_url": "https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Goldenn-Horde-CSDBs-1024x636.jpeg", "img_describe": "Four Collaborative Small Diameter Bombs (CSDBs) hang from the wing of an F-16 fighter from the Air Force Test Center’s 96th Test Wing at Eglin AFB.

A third contract for $5 million was awarded this April, and another $5 million contract will be inked later this month, the email added, bringing the total awards (funded by both RSO and the Propulsion Directorate) so far up to $13.76 million.</p>\n<p>While the F110 sump cover is a small part, it is nonetheless important to how the engine — used by both the F-15 and F-16 fighter jets — functions. Its air worthiness certification moves the Air Force closer to its goal of <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/09/air-force-pushes-3d-printing-to-boost-readiness/\">expanding the use of 3D printing </a>to boost aircraft readiness.

{"title": "Biden’s Intelligence Community Must Focus On Climate Crisis", "publish_time": "2020-12-15 18:15:14", "author": ["Anthony Vinci"], "content": "President Elect Biden has signaled that he is going to\ntreat the climate crisis as a national security issue\nby appointing John Kerry as his Special Envoy for Climate and making him a member of the National Security Council. For Kerry to succeed, he will need intelligence. The climate crisis is a national security issue and the Intelligence Community (IC) must respond with the same focus and investments it makes into other national security issues.\nNot only does climate change create significant security threats to America through multiplying global instability, it is also a major component of the great power competition with China and Russia. The incoming Biden administration can do much to address climate change as a national security issue. An important first step would be to make changes in the IC so it has the capabilities and focus to help policy makers preserve American interests.\nOne war appears to have started and been fought over climate change in Darfur, Sudan. UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon labeled the conflict as such because water scarcity played such an important role in causing that conflict. The UN is not alone in seeing the threat. A\npast Quadrennial Defense Review\nnoted that the effects of climate change “...are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions – conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.” Recent testimony by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence noted implications of climate change ranging from effects on the stability of countries to competition over resources to human migration.\nClimate change plays a central role in the great power competitions unfolding between America, China and Russia. The melting of the polar icecaps has already led the three to jockey for position for trade and military usage of the Arctic. Changing weather patterns and rising sea levels will require new infrastructure that can either be filled by China’s Belt and Road Initiative or Western approaches. International responses to climate change, such as China’s goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, are now part of a great power information competition to attract the hearts and minds of people around the world.\nThe threats from the climate crisis are significant and much needs to be done. One place to start is ensuring that our nation’s decision makers have the intelligence they need to make decisions. Today, we are not doing enough. A recent\ncongressional report on competition with China\npoints out that “[t]he Intelligence Community places insufficient emphasis and focus on “soft,” often interconnected long-term national security threats, such as infectious diseases of pandemic potential and climate change...”\nPrevious attempts by the IC to address the geopolitical aspects of climate change have been shut down. The CIA set up the Measurements of Earth Data for Environmental Analysis (MEDEA) program in the 1990s. It provided scientists with security clearances and allowed them to access classified information, such as historical satellite imagery, to support their climate change research. The CIA also set up a Center on Climate Change and National Security, which studied just what it said it would. Both of these offices were closed years ago, although the threats posed by climate change have only grown.\nThe Intelligence Community’s mission, in its own words, is to “collect, analyze and deliver foreign intelligence information to America’s leaders so they can make sound decisions.” To carry out its mission, the IC must provide climate change intelligence, whether it’s to a president who must make a decision on environmental policy, a diplomat who must negotiate international agreements, or a war planner who must determine how to preposition troops for potential future conflicts.\nTo do this the IC must develop several capabilities to address the geopolitical consequences of climate change.\nFirst, the IC must double down on efforts to use open source information, work with non-governmental organizations and share information like the aforementioned MEDEA program once did.\nSecond, because there is so much open source information and it differs so radically from traditional intelligence reporting, the IC will need to continue on its path of incorporating AI and data science techniques so that analysts can understand the wide-scale change over time caused by climate change and thereby forecast potential geopolitical effects.\nThird, the IC requires new expertise and new public private partnerships. The CIA and other agencies need to hire cadres of environmental scientists and experts. New partnerships need to be formed with global organizations focused on climate change data collection and science. Doing so will require that the IC works hard to rebuild trust after years of bad perception by some of the public.\nOf course, there will still be secrets that will need to be collected and analyzed. For example, the Chinese Communist Party regularly withholds or changes political, social and economic data. To understand climate change’s effects on China or the party’s true plans, the IC will need to use traditional secret information collection approaches. In other cases, the IC may need to devote classified resources, such as imagery satellites or submarine data collection, to collecting climate change data which can contribute to understanding the details and outcomes of climate change.\nFinally, a sign of the Intelligence Community’s seriousness would be to assign an executive agent and create a mission center devoted to climate change. While it may seem that the intelligence community may not have the mindset for such a public mission, one option to consider is the\nNational Geospatial Intelligence Agency\n(NGA). NGA’s focus on global imagery, geospatial datasets and mapping, as well as its comfort with working with open source information, the academy and the private sector, make it a good candidate. For example, NGA led a project with the National Science Foundation, the University of Minnesota and ESRI to map the arctic and then released that digital elevation map (DEM) to the public.\nPresident Elect Biden, Special Envoy Kerry and the rest of the US government need the right intelligence to make the right decisions in a world confronting a climate crisis. The IC must carry out its duty to provide this intelligence.\nAnthony Vinci, former associate director and chief technology officer of NGA, is an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS).", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-131498\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/NGA-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/NGA-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/NGA-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/NGA-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/NGA-210x140.jpg 210w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/NGA.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"/></p>\n<p>President Elect Biden has signaled that he is going to <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/climate-change/\">treat the climate crisis as a national security issue</a> by appointing John Kerry as his Special Envoy for Climate and making him a member of the National Security Council.

Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: The US needs to work with allies and partners to compete with China in high tech, not go it alone, leaders of a\nbipartisan commission\nsaid Thursday.\n“I went with the chairman of the seapower committee on HASC,\nJoe Courtney\n, the chairman of the Friends of Australia Caucus, to Australia,” recalled Rep. Mike Gallagher, the Republican co-chair of the congressionally chartered Cyberspace Solarium Commission. In particular, they visited\nwestern Australia\n, a major source of rare earth minerals essential to many high-tech products – minerals that, today, the US mostly gets from China.\n“Our biggest takeaway,” he told a\nCNAS webcast\nThursday, “was the need to ... really enhance our partnership, particularly with our Five Eyes allies” – Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and the US – “and Japan” – which made major investments in its rare earths supply after China put it under embargo.\n“We had a small victory in the National Defense Authorization Act,” Gallagher added. “It was an amendment that Courtney and I authored that would require the SecDef to prioritize the acquisition of strategic and critical minerals from US\nand allied\nsources.” (Emphasis ours).\nOverall, Gallagher said, Congress is taking the Chinese threat seriously and moving out but that isn’t guided by a clear strategy. “I think, in our eagerness to do something about a very real challenge, the United States has leapt without a plan of action,” he said. “We’ve had some positive developments ... like the\nAmerican Foundries Act\n,\nthe CHIPS Act\n, the Telecoms Act. But we need a broader strategic effort to shore up our ICT [information and communications technologies] supply chains.”\nThe commission’s goal is to provide some of that\nstrategic forethought\n.\nAll too often, the commission’s executive director, retired Rear Adm.\nMark Montgomery\nsaid, “we almost immediately turn every issue to a national security issue and quickly look for a US-based solution...We at the commission tried hard not to do that. I’m kind excited about the opportunities we have in rare earth elements” in particular, he said. “I fear trying to either legislate – or through the executive branch, direct – a US-only solution.”\nThe commission studied strategic minerals from relatively common ones like silicon and germanium, to esoteric rare earths, Montgomery explained. “We used to be a leading extraction, mining, and refining country, but it is a very messy process,” he said. The high costs of both environmental protection and American labor have repeatedly scuppered attempts to revive domestic production of strategic minerals, he said.\nWhile some US mines are still in production, limited refinery capacity means that “the reality is what we mine right now already gets sent back to China,” he said. “China has too much of an advantage for us to compete. It would just be putting a lot of money down a hole.”\nBut “there are allies and partners that can do this,” Montgomery emphasized. “Rare earth elements is one of those great opportunities to identify allies and partners that we can rely on to either to mine ... or do the refining.”\nRare earths aren’t the only area where cooperation with allies works better than going it alone, added the executive VP of the Intelligence Community’s venture capital arm,\nIn-Q-Tel\n, who, while not a part of the commission, praised its work.\n“There’s a bit of a bias ... to want to own and to protect physically the supply chain,” said In-Q-Tel’s\nSarah Sewall\n. “And that’s really important, and the [Solarium] white paper has some great recommendations on how to do that, and there’s a lot of momentum now in Congress.\n“But... as the commission points out, you can’t onshore everything. We live in a globalized world, we have a globalized supply chain,” she said. “You have to figure out what’s the minimum required amount that you need to be able to produce at home. You also have to accept the fact that you’re going to still rely on external components in some cases.\n“We also have to recognize that what’s allowed us to be leaders in these technologies overall has\nnot\nbeen the reliability of our supplies and the ability to make them on American territory,” Sewall cautioned. “It’s been our ability to innovate” – and innovation requires being open to the world. Rather than treating foreign students with suspicion, she said, “we need to welcome talent.”\nAustralia is a particularly useful partner in this area as well. “The Australians have really extraordinary quantum talent,” said Sewall, who as part of the Intelligence Community’s investment arm is keenly interested in the ability of quantum sensing and computing to pierce present-day security measures. “The US and Australian firms like to share talent and some of our export regs even seem to [hinder] the movement of persons and their ability to come to an American firm. We’re going to have to look at all of that miasma that gets in the way [of] the need to really build a democratic coalition of trusted partners,” Sewall said. “We’re going to have to really pool our intellectual learning together.”\nThat openness, she added, seems to be “congruent with President Biden’s mentality of what it means to open America to a global world.”\nRep. Gallagher, a Republican didn’t outright endorse the incoming Democratic administration. But he was optimistic about the possibility for bipartisan cooperation – even on industrial policy, a topic that was historically toxic for the GOP.\n“It was amazing to me how many of the Republican commissioners, both legislators and outside experts, were willing to utter the dirty ‘i-word’ from the start of our discussions,” Gallagher said. Whether you want to call it “industrial policy” or “industrial base strategy,” he said, “we do believe that’s an area where the federal government needs to be more proactive, a little bit more prescriptive.”\nOverall, when he looks ahead to what can be accomplished, “I’m very excited,” Gallagher said. “I have engaged with the\nincoming Biden national security team\n. I am , let’s say, cautiously optimistic about some of the personalities they may be considering for key cyber-related positions.... I will look forward to working with them the same ways I worked with the previous administration.”\n“At a time when we’re obviously seeing divisions and political tribalism front and center, and manifested in some very dark and ugly ways, I just want to show you that, as a member of Congress, work like this is exceptionally bipartisan,” said Gallagher, a moderate who\npublicly urged\nhis GOP colleagues to certify Biden’s electoral college victory. “There’s just a huge opportunity to build upon it, and it’s so critically important.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The US needs to work with allies and partners to compete with China in high tech, not go it alone, leaders of a <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/cyberspace-solarium-commission/\">bipartisan commission</a> said Thursday.</p>\n<p>“I went with the chairman of the seapower committee on HASC, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/rep-joe-courtney/\">Joe Courtney</a>, the chairman of the Friends of Australia Caucus, to Australia,” recalled Rep.

Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: While 2020 disrupted testing, the Army’s next big upgrade to its Integrated Tactical Network, ITN\nCapability Set 21\n, remains on track to field to four brigades this year and five more in 2022, two generals confirmed this morning, speaking from the sidelines of a key test at Fort Bragg.\n[\nClick here for our full coverage of AFCEA NOVA’s 2021 Army IT Days]\n“[We’re] right in the middle of the operational test” for CS21’s new handheld and backpack radios, said\nMaj. Gen. Peter Gallagher\n, the\nNetwork Cross Functional Team\n(CFT) director at Army Futures Command. Gallagher was calling in to an\nAFCEA NOVA conference\nalongside his counterpart for procurement,\nBrig. Gen. Robert Collins\n, the Program Executive Officer for Command, Control, & Communications – Tactical (\nPEO-C3T\n).\n“Gen. Collins and I today are actually on the ground at Fort Bragg,” Gallagher said, where they joined soldiers of the famed 82\nnd\nAirborne Division in a field exercise simulating a “movement to contact” with an enemy force.\nThe Army issued an early version of CS21 to the 82\nnd\n’s 1\nst\nBrigade\nand had planned extensive field tests in 2020. But the Airborne is the Army’s global rapid-response force, and the 1\nst\nBrigade had two unscheduled deployments last year: one to the\nMideast\nafter US drones killed Iranian general\nQassem Soleimani\nand sparked a regional crisis, the other to Washington, DC after police killed George Floyd and set of nationwide protests.\nThose real-world crises, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, forced the Army to postpone some tests and downsize others from a full brigade to just part of one. That’s why the Pentagon’s independent Director of Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) urged the Army to slow down in its\nannual report\nfor 2020, submitted to Congress on\nJan. 13\n.\n“There has not been an opportunity to evaluate the operational effectiveness, suitability, or survivability of an ITN-equipped IBCT [\nInfantry Brigade Combat Team\n] under its current configuration, because of the delays in testing due to real-world events,”\nDOT&E said\n. “The Army should....[d]elay fielding decisions for the ITN until the Brigade-level JRTC [Joint Readiness Training Center] rotation in 2021. This delay will allow the Army to decide on the first operational fielding of the ITN based on the experiences of a full Brigade using the equipment as well as complete analysis from the technical test.”\nThe brigade will take its CS21 technology to the Fort Polk JRTC for intensive wargames this coming March. That was “always” part of the Army’s testing plan, said Gallagher – but it won’t be a make-or-break event that by itself determines whether or not to field the network upgrades.\n“We don’t want to make the fielding hang in the balance based on the upcoming JRTC rotation,” Gallagher said. Instead, the Fort Polk wargames will be just one opportunity among many to gather feedback from real soldiers in the field and use that data to improve CS21.\nThat’s because the Army isn’t following the traditional procurement process for its Integrated Tactical Network, but rather the streamlined Mid-Tier Acquisition process, also known as\nSection 804\n. While traditional programs try to work out all the bugs in their technology before putting it through a rigid series of formal tests, the Army network is trying to repeatedly and rapidly make small improvements, field-test them with real soldiers, make fixes based on that feedback, and then field-test again – a Silicon Valley approach known as “\nagile development” or DevSecOps\n.\n“We test to learn and we learn to improve,” said Brig. Gen. Collins. Brigade deployments to\nCombat Training Centers\nlike Fort Polk are “certainly... part of our iterative strategy,” he said. “We’ve got a very methodical approach to be able to collect that data [and] apply those lessons-learned.”\nThe coming months are busy for the Army’s network modernization program, the generals said. For Capability Set 21, there’s the radio test underway right now at Fort Bragg and the brigade wargames in March at Fort Polk, and a Preliminary Design Review (PDR). But the Army’s already assessing potential technologies for the next biennial upgrade,\nCapability Set 23\n, which will go through its Preliminary Design Review in April.\nMeanwhile, the Army’s also in the middle of its first Communications Exercise (COMEX 1) to prepare for the annual\nProject Convergence\nexperiment this fall, which will field-test not just\nthe network\nbut a host of other weapons that rely on it to share data, from mini-drones to long-range missiles. The Army’s also conducting joint experiments with the other services to try\nsharing data across their separate networks\n, including an upcoming demonstration of the Air Force’s\nAdvanced Battle Management System\n(ABMS). And in April, the Army will connect its network to those of allies, linking III Corps HQ, its subordinate units, and two European divisions – one British and one French – for a\nvirtual and international Warfighter Exercise\n.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: While 2020 disrupted testing, the Army’s next big upgrade to its Integrated Tactical Network, ITN <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/capability-set-21/\">Capability Set 21</a>, remains on track to field to four brigades this year and five more in 2022, two generals confirmed this morning, speaking from the sidelines of a key test at Fort Bragg.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/afcea-army-it-day-2021/\">Click here for our full coverage of AFCEA NOVA’s 2021 Army IT Days]</a></p>\n<p>“[We’re] right in the middle of the operational test” for CS21’s new handheld and backpack radios, said <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/11/project-rainmaker-army-weaves-data-fabric-to-link-joint-networks/\">Maj.

This opinion piece by Hoss Cartwright, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and former Air Force Secretary Debbie Lee James, makes it pretty clear they believe the new service will play a key role for both the military and the commercial world in the future as they grapple with the challenges of the vast possible riches of commerce in space. Cartwright, of course, was the widely respected head of Strategic Command (the first commander to start talking about long-range precision strike in various guises) and then vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs. James was the second female Air Force secretary and has opposed creation of the Space Force, arguing that Space Command’s creation is more important. What’s the way ahead?\nRead on! The Editor.\nThe twenty-first century is witnessing\nan epic rush to outer space.\nJust as the discovery of gold in California created mass migration to the American West in 1848, the potential for generating wealth in space is propelling US allies, adversaries, and industry alike to launch into orbit.\nTo manage this, the new US administration must develop a 30-year strategy to secure space and promote full-bodied governance for the astounding commercial expansion currently underway. Security and prosperity in space is an ambition larger than any one nation;\nall of humanity should reap these benefits\n. Otherwise, the rules-based order will remain terrestrial while US adversaries champion an alternate vision for space.\nSpace development is analogous to the opening of previously flourishing domains, where surveying and regulation turned frontiers into today’s metropoles. As exploration uncovers value, an influx of actors joins the apparatus. Upon the discovery of gold, nearly 240,000 people rushed to California. Lawless competition proceeded as actors exploited new resources without accountability. In California, the abundant resources deteriorated as the newcomers dammed rivers, chopped trees, and mined the land. Gold Rush anarchy served as an impetus for building mining infrastructure and for signing a new state constitution. With governance providing surety, commercial actors further exploited minerals for economic gain. The United States tamed the chaos. Today’s space domain could be on the verge of catastrophe. Why? If commercial activity progresses without regulation, a chain reaction of space collisions – known as Kessler Syndrome –could render space unusable for hundreds of years.\nToday’s space rush is distinctive from the space race, which began with Russia’s 1957 Sputnik 1 launch and concluded with Neil Armstrong staking an American flag on the Moon in 1969. While national pride motivated these early space achievements, economic promise drives twenty-first century advancements. Rather than astronauts and spy satellites, spacefaring companies aspire to bring ordinary citizens to space and build mega-constellations of nano-satellites. Great-power competition has ascended to the space domain, with China and Russia trailing behind the United States in some space technology developments, but leading in other important areas like quantum communications.\nIn the absence of order, the activities of agile companies and great-powers threaten to turn this high frontier into a Wild West. In the short term, constellations of small satellites are concerning astronomers. The next decade will likely bring private-sector space tourism and asteroid mining, neither of which is well-regulated.\nThe space domain has already undergone a significant period of scientific discovery. Scientists have found evidence of life on other planets, resources on the Moon, and the existence of other galaxies. Space is ingrained in the future ofsociety, economy, and security. Grasping the possibilities in outer space, governments are struggling for space expansion.\nSpace has long been used for national security ends, but the domain’s security has not been addressed. Great-power competition among the United States, China, and Russia has launched into outer space without rules governing the game. In January 2007, China ushered in a new period of space instability when its anti-satellite missile test\ngenerated a dangerous debris cloud\nand demonstrated its ability to disrupt low-Earth orbit missions. In February 2020, two Russian satellites trailed a US spy satellite, effectively transporting Russia’s doctrine of military deception to space. Although space is now defined by a multitude of national programs, it is largely governed by the outdated Outer Space Treaty of 1967, signed in an era characterized by US-Soviet superpower rivalry.\nUnstable security structures threaten the continued commercialization of outer space. Industry innovators are already outpacing space governance. With the global space industry projected to generate over $1 trillion in revenue in 2040, aerospace incumbents and new space firms are accelerating space access with ambitious projects from reusable launch to Internet from space to inflatable space habitats. Indeed, history may mark SpaceX’s pathbreaking first operational crewed-launch of a commercial rocket to the International Space Station — just months ago — as the dawn of a new era of spaceflight.\nWhile visionary corporate leaders may be willing to take high risks on space, a more routinized space economy will rely on markets to price risk and insure space activity. Normalizing business in space will require the United States to provide the public good of security in Earth orbit, just as the US Navy instills confidence in maritime commerce on the high seas.\nIf the United States does not develop a framework for outer space competition, instability will ensue as adversaries claim sovereignty of the global commons and commercial objectives are disrupted. It is imperative that the United States shows leadership in space to avoid cascading consequences for space stability. The United States and like-minded nations should extend the rules-based order to outer space or risk Russia and China filling this gap with an alternative vision that does not comport with US and allied values and norms. Operating over half of the world’s 2,787 satellites, the United States remains a key player in space and therefore is in a position to leverage its space achievements to shape this domain of limitless opportunities.\nA new 30-year US strategy for space should advance stability to protect vital interests in the space domain. First, the United States must lead in launching the global governance that guides traditional domains into orbit. Similar to the International Civil Aviation Organization’s role in the air domain, space needs operational standards, such as agreed-upon launch and orbit coordination protocols, to provide a basis for space traffic management and socialize global cooperation for future capabilities like rocket transportation. Through convening and participating in global conventions and creating new entities for space coordination, accountability, and enforcement, the United States should assemble relevant actors to create a space security framework reflective of the depth and breadth of space activity today.\nAfter establishing mechanisms for international coordination, the United States must identify and protect prime orbital “real estate,” such as gravitationally balanced Lagrange points that optimize satellite energy usage. Upon agreeing to protect the gateways of outer space, the international community can begin to build resilient architecture to promote space sustainability for the coming decades.\nFinally, the United States must coordinate a whole-of-government and -nation and allied response, as the applications of space stretch across society. Through engaging existing space institutions, such as NASA, Space Force, and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, and establishing new ones, the United States can account for wide-ranging US interests in outer space.\nTime is of the essence to implement a new long-term US strategy reflective of a rapidly changing domain where commerce is increasingly the most important feature, but fully integrated into a robust governance and security construct that benefits humanity. The decisions and investments of the new US administration will determine whether the United States maintains or relinquishes its status as the world’s leading spacefaring nation. Missions promoting space stability today will impact the security and prosperity of humankind tomorrow.\nJames “Hoss” Cartwright, former commander of Strategic Command and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Deborah Lee James, twenty-third Air Force Secretary, are co-chairs for “The Future of Security in Space: A Thirty-Year US Strategy,” an Atlantic Council paper to be released in early April.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<i>How strategically important is space, beyond spy and communications satellites?

The Editor.</em>\n<p>The twenty-first century is witnessing <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/commercial-space/\">an epic rush to outer space.</a> Just as the discovery of gold in California created mass migration to the American West in 1848, the potential for generating wealth in space is propelling US allies, adversaries, and industry alike to launch into orbit.</p>\n<p>To manage this, the new US administration must develop a 30-year strategy to secure space and promote full-bodied governance for the astounding commercial expansion currently underway. Security and prosperity in space is an ambition larger than any one nation; <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/space-warfare/\">all of humanity should reap these benefits</a>. Otherwise, the rules-based order will remain terrestrial while US adversaries champion an alternate vision for space.</p>\n<p>Space development is analogous to the opening of previously flourishing domains, where surveying and regulation turned frontiers into today’s metropoles. As exploration uncovers value, an influx of actors joins the apparatus. Upon the discovery of gold, nearly 240,000 people rushed to California. Lawless competition proceeded as actors exploited new resources without accountability. In California, the abundant resources deteriorated as the newcomers dammed rivers, chopped trees, and mined the land. Gold Rush anarchy served as an impetus for building mining infrastructure and for signing a new state constitution. With governance providing surety, commercial actors further exploited minerals for economic gain. The United States tamed the chaos. Today’s space domain could be on the verge of catastrophe. Why? If commercial activity progresses without regulation, a chain reaction of space collisions – known as Kessler Syndrome –could render space unusable for hundreds of years.</p>\n<p>Today’s space rush is distinctive from the space race, which began with Russia’s 1957 Sputnik 1 launch and concluded with Neil Armstrong staking an American flag on the Moon in 1969. While national pride motivated these early space achievements, economic promise drives twenty-first century advancements. Rather than astronauts and spy satellites, spacefaring companies aspire to bring ordinary citizens to space and build mega-constellations of nano-satellites. Great-power competition has ascended to the space domain, with China and Russia trailing behind the United States in some space technology developments, but leading in other important areas like quantum communications.</p>\n<p>In the absence of order, the activities of agile companies and great-powers threaten to turn this high frontier into a Wild West. In the short term, constellations of small satellites are concerning astronomers. The next decade will likely bring private-sector space tourism and asteroid mining, neither of which is well-regulated.</p>\n<p>The space domain has already undergone a significant period of scientific discovery. Scientists have found evidence of life on other planets, resources on the Moon, and the existence of other galaxies. Space is ingrained in the future ofsociety, economy, and security. Grasping the possibilities in outer space, governments are struggling for space expansion.</p>\n<p>Space has long been used for national security ends, but the domain’s security has not been addressed. Great-power competition among the United States, China, and Russia has launched into outer space without rules governing the game. In January 2007, China ushered in a new period of space instability when its anti-satellite missile test<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/space-debris/\"> generated a dangerous debris cloud</a> and demonstrated its ability to disrupt low-Earth orbit missions. In February 2020, two Russian satellites trailed a US spy satellite, effectively transporting Russia’s doctrine of military deception to space. Although space is now defined by a multitude of national programs, it is largely governed by the outdated Outer Space Treaty of 1967, signed in an era characterized by US-Soviet superpower rivalry.</p>\n<p>Unstable security structures threaten the continued commercialization of outer space. Industry innovators are already outpacing space governance. With the global space industry projected to generate over $1 trillion in revenue in 2040, aerospace incumbents and new space firms are accelerating space access with ambitious projects from reusable launch to Internet from space to inflatable space habitats. Indeed, history may mark SpaceX’s pathbreaking first operational crewed-launch of a commercial rocket to the International Space Station — just months ago — as the dawn of a new era of spaceflight.</p>\n<p>While visionary corporate leaders may be willing to take high risks on space, a more routinized space economy will rely on markets to price risk and insure space activity. Normalizing business in space will require the United States to provide the public good of security in Earth orbit, just as the US Navy instills confidence in maritime commerce on the high seas.</p>\n<p>If the United States does not develop a framework for outer space competition, instability will ensue as adversaries claim sovereignty of the global commons and commercial objectives are disrupted. It is imperative that the United States shows leadership in space to avoid cascading consequences for space stability. The United States and like-minded nations should extend the rules-based order to outer space or risk Russia and China filling this gap with an alternative vision that does not comport with US and allied values and norms. Operating over half of the world’s 2,787 satellites, the United States remains a key player in space and therefore is in a position to leverage its space achievements to shape this domain of limitless opportunities.</p>\n<p>A new 30-year US strategy for space should advance stability to protect vital interests in the space domain. First, the United States must lead in launching the global governance that guides traditional domains into orbit. Similar to the International Civil Aviation Organization’s role in the air domain, space needs operational standards, such as agreed-upon launch and orbit coordination protocols, to provide a basis for space traffic management and socialize global cooperation for future capabilities like rocket transportation. Through convening and participating in global conventions and creating new entities for space coordination, accountability, and enforcement, the United States should assemble relevant actors to create a space security framework reflective of the depth and breadth of space activity today.</p>\n<p>After establishing mechanisms for international coordination, the United States must identify and protect prime orbital “real estate,” such as gravitationally balanced Lagrange points that optimize satellite energy usage. Upon agreeing to protect the gateways of outer space, the international community can begin to build resilient architecture to promote space sustainability for the coming decades.</p>\n<p>Finally, the United States must coordinate a whole-of-government and -nation and allied response, as the applications of space stretch across society. Through engaging existing space institutions, such as NASA, Space Force, and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, and establishing new ones, the United States can account for wide-ranging US interests in outer space.</p>\n<p>Time is of the essence to implement a new long-term US strategy reflective of a rapidly changing domain where commerce is increasingly the most important feature, but fully integrated into a robust governance and security construct that benefits humanity. The decisions and investments of the new US administration will determine whether the United States maintains or relinquishes its status as the world’s leading spacefaring nation. Missions promoting space stability today will impact the security and prosperity of humankind tomorrow.</p>\n<em>James “Hoss” Cartwright, former commander of Strategic Command and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Deborah Lee James, twenty-third Air Force Secretary, are co-chairs for “The Future of Security in Space: A Thirty-Year US Strategy,” an Atlantic Council paper to be released in early April.</em>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["commercial space", "Debbie Lee James", "hoss cartwright", "James Cartwright", "national security space", "op-ed. op-eds. commentary", "satellites", "space command", "Space Force"], "categories": [], "img_data": [{"img_url": "https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/spacecommandbadge.jpg", "img_describe": "The flag of U.S. Space Command is unfurled at the White House in August, 2019", "img_name": "news/img_2021_07_21_60f798e1435cc49f1f88d7aa.png"}], "video_data": [], "url": "https://breakingdefense.com/2021/03/the-space-rush-new-us-strategy-must-bring-order-regulation/", "site_name": "breakingdefense", "insert_time": "2021-07-21 11:47:45"}

{"title": "What’s In A Name? Billions In Cuts Depend On Defining ‘Legacy’", "publish_time": "2021-03-10 13:30:33", "author": ["Mark CancianAdam Saxton"], "content": "How DoD defines “legacy systems” will drive tens of billions of dollars of investment, sustainment activities, and force structure. Everyone criticizes legacy systems, and in an era of\ndeclining budgets\nand\nrising major power challengers\n, they are targets for\ncost-cutting efforts to fund modernization\n. But what are legacy systems? The services define legacy systems as old versions of systems that they are currently buying: an F-18 being replaced by an\nF-35\n, for instance. In contrast, many independent strategists define legacy systems as old\nkinds\nof systems―those based on outmoded operational concepts: Here, legacy might mean a manned fighter of any kind, as opposed to something truly novel, like a\nswarm of drones\n.\nThe debate affects all the military services. For the Air Force, the discussion will center on tactical aviation,\nespecially the F-35\n; for the Navy, carriers and cruisers; for the Army, ground combat vehicles and rotary-wing aircraft. DoD’s\nCost Assessment & Program Evaluation\n(CAPE) group will be driving the decision. It worries especially about affordability, which may induce it to incorporate some of both concepts. Finally, Congress will make the final decision, and it has its own ideas.\nEveryone criticizes “legacy systems.”\nThe Biden administration’s recently issued\nInterim National Security Strategic Guidance\npledges “working with the Congress, [to] shift the emphasis from unneeded legacy platforms and weapon systems to free up resources for investments in the cutting-edge technologies and capabilities that will determine our military and national security advantage in the future.”\nSec. Austin’s March 4 “Message to the Force”\nuses almost identical language: “where necessary, we will divest of legacy systems in programs that no longer meet our security needs, while investing smartly in the future.” Neither, however, specifies what systems are “legacy.”\nDemocrats are not alone. Republican Senator James Inhofe recently called for\n“moderniz[ing] or replac[ing] legacy systems.”\nFormer Secretary of Defense Mark Esper similarly\nsupported divesting legacy systems\nin light of flat defense budgets.\nThe service definition: old systems.\nThe military services look at legacy systems as older systems that are being replaced with newer systems of the same variety. For example, Gen. Charles Q. Brown, the new Air Force Chief of Staff, cited the need for\n“ruthless prioritization,”\nwhich would retire old manned aircraft to buy new manned aircraft like the F-35, B-21, and KC-46. Indeed, the Air Force has frequently tried to shed older systems, as\nin the FY 2021 budget request where it tried to retire 108 older airframes\n.\nThe Navy\nwants to retire the aging CG-47\nTiconderoga-\nclass cruisers\nand buy new surface combatants. The Navy has also sought to retire\nNimitz\n-class carriers early but keep building the more capable\nFord\n-class carriers.\nThe Marine Corps says it wants to retire\n“tired iron”\n– early-model F-18 fighters – as quickly as possible and buy F-35s.\nThe Army wants to\nreplace its Bradley combat vehicle\nwith another, modernized troop carrier, albeit a potentially self-driving one, the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle. Similarly, it wants to\nreplace its Apache attack helicopters\nwith a futuristic attack reconnaissance aircraft.\nThe strategists’ definition: old\nkinds\nof systems.\nMany strategists say that all these approaches are wrong, mired in “old think” and ignoring new ways of warfare. These strategists focus on the demands of great power conflict, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. They envision such a conflict employing a radically different set of operational concepts from past wars. Thus, they emphasize capabilities that are long-range, precision, networked, distributed, unmanned, and individually less expensive. They abhor “exquisite” systems that are extremely capable but also extremely expensive and fielded in limited numbers.\nThese future-oriented strategists regard as legacy even the new, more capable versions of existing platforms. Instead, they would acquire different\nkinds\nof systems. Christian Brose, for example, has described the\nF-35 Joint Strike Fighter and\nVirginia\n-class submarines\nas “legacy programs.” In his book\nThe Kill Chain\nhe argues for “replacing legacy platforms with large networks of autonomous systems.” He would also “replac[e] large warships with large quantities of land-based anti-ship missiles [and] replac[e] ground systems with networks of unmanned combat aircraft” – that is, swarming drones.\nT.X. Hammes\nhas similarly argued\nthat “by employing air, land, and sea legacy systems that have been dominant in their domains for over 70 years, the Pentagon risks going the same way as the armored knights and battleships.” For Hammes and others,\n“current large warships and manned aircraft”\nare all legacy weapons. Instead, Hammes recommends that the services experiment ruthlessly and incorporate autonomous systems.\nSusanna Blume has focused especially on\n“kill chains”\nand their supporting sensors and shooters. Regarding the Army, she has referred to the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters, Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, and upgrades to the M-1 Abrams and Bradley vehicles\nas legacy systems\n. Instead, she calls for increased R&D in\nunmanned vehicles, along with manned-unmanned teaming\n.\nMany of these strategists see aircraft carriers themselves as a legacy platform that is increasingly expensive and requiring more next generation systems to defend. Naval strategist Jerry Hendrix is blunt:\n“[the Navy] needs to stop building aircraft carriers\n....Rather than dedicate such new technologies as directed energy, electromagnetic rail guns, and hypersonic propulsion systems to propping up and defending a legacy platform, it should free these systems to find a place in a revolutionary new fleet that is marked by lower costs and ruthless efficiency.”\nMoney eased the tension during the Trump administration.\nThe\n2018\nNational Defense Strategy\nleaned towards the strategists’ perspective: “We cannot expect success fighting tomorrow’s conflicts with yesterday’s weapons or equipment.” However, it never got enough traction to make major changes in acquisition as the services continued to invest in their flagship programs. The Army bought ground combat vehicles and rotary-wing aircraft. The Navy bought carriers, surface combatants, and submarines. The Air Force bought manned fighters and bombers. In part, the services did not need to choose because the rising budget allowed both continuation of the existing modernization programs and investments in new concepts.\nAs part of these new concepts, all the services experimented with new unmanned systems – Air Force\nSkyborg\n, Navy\nMQ-25\n,\nunmanned surface/subsurface vehi\ncles, Army and Marine Corps\nunmanned ground vehicles\n– and invested in long-range precision munitions. They also added less costly, often smaller systems where that did not detract from the flagship systems but which implemented what the strategist camp would consider new operational concepts. Thus, the Navy instituted a\nnew frigate program\nand a light amphibious warfare ship, the\nAir Force bought some F-15EXs\n, and the Army considered the\nMobile Protected Firepower light tank\n.\nConcepts will clash in the new DoD reviews.\nTightening budgets will force a clash between the dueling definitions of legacy. The Trump administration forecast a defense budget that was level in constant dollars. The consensus on the Biden administration defense budget envisions a modest cut. In addition to these external pressures,\nrising compensation costs needed to compete for labor in the open market\nand the inexorable increase in operations and maintenance costs put internal pressure on the budget.\nTo prepare an FY 2022 budget submission, expected in late April or early May, DoD has announced reviews of global force posture, tactical aviation, naval forces, and long-range fires. Battles over the interpretation of “legacy” will play out in these reviews.\nCAPE will adjudicate the dispute.\nThe Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) will lead many of these reviews. It has immense analytic power, but its influence waxes and wanes with its relationship to the senior leadership. That influence looks like it will increase as many commentators, including\nsome in the administration\n, have decried a perceived imbalance between military advice, often embodied in the Joint Staff, and civilian advice embodied in OSD.\nCAPE has traditionally worried about long-term affordability. That may drive it to adopt elements of both definitions of “legacy.” Consistent with the service definition, it has often proposed upgraded current systems in the past: Thus, it championed the “fourth generation plus” F-15EX because of its lower sustainment cost compared to the “fifth generation” F-35, even though acquisition cost was about the same. It may support upgrades of other systems as a low-cost mechanism to maintain force structure. There may similarly be an effort to constrain requirements on new systems. That might lead to an effort to redefine NGAD as a low-cost F-16 replacement (which the F-35 was originally supposed to be) rather than a high-end, expensive F-22 replacement.\nConsistent with the strategist view, CAPE will likely emphasize long-range precision strike rather than manned platforms that penetrate adversary air space. Thus, CAPE may recommend procuring missile systems like JASM/\nLRASM\n,\nSM-6\n, and\nTomahawk\nthat can be fired from existing platforms that stay outside of\nan adversary’s air defenses\n. That may raise questions about the\nB-21\nbomber, whose stealthy characteristics are designed to take it deep into adversary air space. In a similar vein, CAPE may propose broader adoption of low-cost unmanned systems.\nCAPE will likely be willing to shrink force size. In its showdown with Secretary of the Navy in 2015, CAPE was willing to cut older ships and shrink fleet size to invest the savings in modernizing the remaining force.\nCongress has its own views.\nAs members of Congress note, the president proposes, and Congress disposes. Thus, Congress will have the last word. However, it is unlikely to support radical changes in structure now that its principal maverick thinker, Sen. John McCain, has passed from the scene.\nCongress has frequently balked at retiring large numbers of older systems, particularly if that makes the force smaller. For example, it has called for a 355-ship fleet and consistently pushed the Navy to modernize rather than retire the CG-47 cruisers. It also refused to allow the Air Force to retire the\nA-10\nfleet. In part, parochial interests drove these decisions. For the A-10s, many aircraft reside in the Guard and reserves, which have strong local constituencies. However, Congress also reflects broader concerns. All the services have cited the need for larger structures to meet both wartime and day-to-day combatant command requirements. Congress is sensitive to stress on servicemembers, which increases if the force gets significantly smaller without a reduction.\nWatch the FY 2022 budget.\nThe FY 2022 budget will provide a first peek at how the administration views “legacy.” Because there is not much time available to do analysis and reach decisions, the administration might make a few changes in FY 2022 and leave the rest to the FY 2023 budget. That will enable incorporation of the results of the administration’s strategic review. (Publication expected late in 2021 or in early February with the FY 2023 budget.) On the other hand, they may opt for a Gates-like budget stroke that incorporates all the major changes in one package.\nOne early warning sign of major change: Watch for officials signing nondisclosure agreements. That was Sec. Gates’s mechanism for ensuring secrecy before revealing the big cut.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>How DoD defines “legacy systems” will drive tens of billions of dollars of investment, sustainment activities, and force structure.

Finally, Congress will make the final decision, and it has its own ideas.</p>\n<em>Everyone criticizes “legacy systems.”</em> The Biden administration’s recently issued <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/03/interim-national-security-strategic-guidance/\"><em>Interim National Security Strategic Guidance</em></a> pledges “working with the Congress, [to] shift the emphasis from unneeded legacy platforms and weapon systems to free up resources for investments in the cutting-edge technologies and capabilities that will determine our military and national security advantage in the future.” <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2525149/secretary-lloyd-j-austin-iii-message-to-the-force/\">Sec. Austin’s March 4 “Message to the Force”</a> uses almost identical language: “where necessary, we will divest of legacy systems in programs that no longer meet our security needs, while investing smartly in the future.” Neither, however, specifies what systems are “legacy.”\n\n<p>Democrats are not alone. Republican Senator James Inhofe recently called for <a href=\"https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-inhofe-maps-out-national-security-priorities-at-sasc-hearing-on-global-security-challenges-and-strategy\">“moderniz[ing] or replac[ing] legacy systems.”</a> Former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper similarly <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/01/24/secdef-congress-let-pentagon-dump-old-gear-fund-new-weapons.html\">supported divesting legacy systems</a> in light of flat defense budgets.</p>\n<em>The service definition: old systems.</em> The military services look at legacy systems as older systems that are being replaced with newer systems of the same variety. For example, Gen. Charles Q. Brown, the new Air Force Chief of Staff, cited the need for <a href=\"https://www.af.mil/Portals/1/documents/2020SAF/ACOL_booklet_FINAL_13_Nov_1006_WEB.pdf\">“ruthless prioritization,”</a> which would retire old manned aircraft to buy new manned aircraft like the F-35, B-21, and KC-46. Indeed, the Air Force has frequently tried to shed older systems, as <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-military-forces-fy-2021-air-force\">in the FY 2021 budget request where it tried to retire 108 older airframes</a>.\n\n<p>The Navy <a href=\"https://news.usni.org/2019/04/08/navy-sees-no-easy-answer-balance-future-surface-fleet\">wants to retire the aging CG-47 <em>Ticonderoga-</em>class cruisers</a> and buy new surface combatants. The Navy has also sought to retire <em>Nimitz</em>-class carriers early but keep building the more capable <em>Ford</em>-class carriers.</p>\n<p>The Marine Corps says it wants to retire <a href=\"https://news.usni.org/2017/03/28/davis-marines-would-save-1billion-in-o-f-18s-struggling-to-stay-mission-ready\">“tired iron”</a> – early-model F-18 fighters – as quickly as possible and buy F-35s.</p>\n<p>The Army wants to <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a32134729/bradley-fighting-vehicle-fourth-replacement/\">replace its Bradley combat vehicle</a> with another, modernized troop carrier, albeit a potentially self-driving one, the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle. Similarly, it wants to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/erictegler/2020/07/22/army-eyes-replacing-apache-with-fara-as-its-kick-in-the-door-attack-helicopter/?sh=3a9a70a627fe\">replace its Apache attack helicopters</a> with a futuristic attack reconnaissance aircraft.</p>\n<em>The strategists’ definition: old <u>kinds</u> of systems. </em>Many strategists say that all these approaches are wrong, mired in “old think” and ignoring new ways of warfare. These strategists focus on the demands of great power conflict, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. They envision such a conflict employing a radically different set of operational concepts from past wars. Thus, they emphasize capabilities that are long-range, precision, networked, distributed, unmanned, and individually less expensive. They abhor “exquisite” systems that are extremely capable but also extremely expensive and fielded in limited numbers.\n<p>These future-oriented strategists regard as legacy even the new, more capable versions of existing platforms. Instead, they would acquire different <u>kinds</u> of systems. Christian Brose, for example, has described the <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-04-16/new-revolution-military-affairs\">F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and <em>Virginia</em>-class submarines</a> as “legacy programs.” In his book <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=CW-nDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT200&lpg=PT200&dq=%22replacing+legacy+platforms+with+large+networks+of+autonomous+systems%22&source=bl&ots=xceGM6zNmj&sig=ACfU3U1X8P-qhtGEmU5NIbYHLPXbS-OrJw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtpJXDyJrvAhWzGFkFHSUpCV0Q6AEwAHoECAEQAw#v=onepage&q=%22replacing%20legacy%20platforms%20with%20large%20networks%20of%20autonomous%20systems%22&f=false\"><em>The Kill Chain</em></a> he argues for “replacing legacy platforms with large networks of autonomous systems.” He would also “replac[e] large warships with large quantities of land-based anti-ship missiles [and] replac[e] ground systems with networks of unmanned combat aircraft” – that is, swarming drones.</p>\n<p>T.X. Hammes <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2018/03/america-is-well-within-range-of-a-big-surprise-so-why-cant-it-see/\">has similarly argued</a> that “by employing air, land, and sea legacy systems that have been dominant in their domains for over 70 years, the Pentagon risks going the same way as the armored knights and battleships.” For Hammes and others, <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/An-Affordable-Defense-of-Asia-Report.pdf\">“current large warships and manned aircraft”</a> are all legacy weapons. Instead, Hammes recommends that the services experiment ruthlessly and incorporate autonomous systems.</p>\n<p>Susanna Blume has focused especially on <a href=\"https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/investing-in-great-power-competition\">“kill chains”</a> and their supporting sensors and shooters. Regarding the Army, she has referred to the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters, Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, and upgrades to the M-1 Abrams and Bradley vehicles <a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/files.cnas.org/documents/CNASReport-The-Bottom-Line-FINALv2.pdf?mtime=20180605115741&focal=none\">as legacy systems</a>. Instead, she calls for increased R&D in <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2019/03/what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting-a-defense-budget-masterpiece/\">unmanned vehicles, along with manned-unmanned teaming</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of these strategists see aircraft carriers themselves as a legacy platform that is increasingly expensive and requiring more next generation systems to defend. Naval strategist Jerry Hendrix is blunt: <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/04/age-aircraft-carrier-over-jerry-hendrix/\">“[the Navy] needs to stop building aircraft carriers</a>....Rather than dedicate such new technologies as directed energy, electromagnetic rail guns, and hypersonic propulsion systems to propping up and defending a legacy platform, it should free these systems to find a place in a revolutionary new fleet that is marked by lower costs and ruthless efficiency.”</p>\n<em>Money eased the tension during the Trump administration.</em> The <a href=\"https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf\">2018 <em>National Defense Strategy</em></a> leaned towards the strategists’ perspective: “We cannot expect success fighting tomorrow’s conflicts with yesterday’s weapons or equipment.” However, it never got enough traction to make major changes in acquisition as the services continued to invest in their flagship programs. The Army bought ground combat vehicles and rotary-wing aircraft. The Navy bought carriers, surface combatants, and submarines. The Air Force bought manned fighters and bombers. In part, the services did not need to choose because the rising budget allowed both continuation of the existing modernization programs and investments in new concepts.\n<p>As part of these new concepts, all the services experimented with new unmanned systems – Air Force <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/skyborg/\">Skyborg</a>, Navy <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/mq-25-stingray/\">MQ-25</a>, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/01/robot-wolfpacks-the-faster-cheaper-355-ship-fleet/\">unmanned surface/subsurface vehi</a>cles, Army and Marine Corps <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/robotic-combat-vehicle/\">unmanned ground vehicles</a> – and invested in long-range precision munitions. They also added less costly, often smaller systems where that did not detract from the flagship systems but which implemented what the strategist camp would consider new operational concepts. Thus, the Navy instituted a <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/04/navy-readies-to-buy-new-frigates-as-industrial-base-wobbles/\">new frigate program</a> and a light amphibious warfare ship, the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/07/boeing-positions-f-15ex-for-abms-digital-century-series/\">Air Force bought some F-15EXs</a>, and the Army considered the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/10/mpf-light-tank-competitors-bae-gd-head-for-soldier-tests/\">Mobile Protected Firepower light tank</a>.</p>\n<em>Concepts will clash in the new DoD reviews.</em> Tightening budgets will force a clash between the dueling definitions of legacy. The Trump administration forecast a defense budget that was level in constant dollars. The consensus on the Biden administration defense budget envisions a modest cut. In addition to these external pressures, <a href=\"https://defense360.csis.org/analysis-of-the-fy-2021-defense-budget/\">rising compensation costs needed to compete for labor in the open market</a> and the inexorable increase in operations and maintenance costs put internal pressure on the budget.\n<p>To prepare an FY 2022 budget submission, expected in late April or early May, DoD has announced reviews of global force posture, tactical aviation, naval forces, and long-range fires. Battles over the interpretation of “legacy” will play out in these reviews.</p>\n<em>CAPE will adjudicate the dispute.</em> The Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) will lead many of these reviews. It has immense analytic power, but its influence waxes and wanes with its relationship to the senior leadership. That influence looks like it will increase as many commentators, including <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2020/05/towards-a-concept-of-good-civilian-guidance/\">some in the administration</a>, have decried a perceived imbalance between military advice, often embodied in the Joint Staff, and civilian advice embodied in OSD.\n<p>CAPE has traditionally worried about long-term affordability. That may drive it to adopt elements of both definitions of “legacy.” Consistent with the service definition, it has often proposed upgraded current systems in the past: Thus, it championed the “fourth generation plus” F-15EX because of its lower sustainment cost compared to the “fifth generation” F-35, even though acquisition cost was about the same. It may support upgrades of other systems as a low-cost mechanism to maintain force structure. There may similarly be an effort to constrain requirements on new systems. That might lead to an effort to redefine NGAD as a low-cost F-16 replacement (which the F-35 was originally supposed to be) rather than a high-end, expensive F-22 replacement.</p>\n<p>Consistent with the strategist view, CAPE will likely emphasize long-range precision strike rather than manned platforms that penetrate adversary air space. Thus, CAPE may recommend procuring missile systems like JASM/<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/lrasm/\">LRASM</a>, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/standard-missile/\">SM-6</a>, and <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/tomahawk/\">Tomahawk</a> that can be fired from existing platforms that stay outside of <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/anti-access-area-denial/\">an adversary’s air defenses</a>. That may raise questions about the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/b-21/\">B-21</a> bomber, whose stealthy characteristics are designed to take it deep into adversary air space. In a similar vein, CAPE may propose broader adoption of low-cost unmanned systems.</p>\n<p>CAPE will likely be willing to shrink force size. In its showdown with Secretary of the Navy in 2015, CAPE was willing to cut older ships and shrink fleet size to invest the savings in modernizing the remaining force.</p>\n<em>Congress has its own views. </em>As members of Congress note, the president proposes, and Congress disposes. Thus, Congress will have the last word. However, it is unlikely to support radical changes in structure now that its principal maverick thinker, Sen. John McCain, has passed from the scene.\n<p>Congress has frequently balked at retiring large numbers of older systems, particularly if that makes the force smaller. For example, it has called for a 355-ship fleet and consistently pushed the Navy to modernize rather than retire the CG-47 cruisers. It also refused to allow the Air Force to retire the<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/a-10/\"> A-10</a> fleet. In part, parochial interests drove these decisions. For the A-10s, many aircraft reside in the Guard and reserves, which have strong local constituencies. However, Congress also reflects broader concerns. All the services have cited the need for larger structures to meet both wartime and day-to-day combatant command requirements. Congress is sensitive to stress on servicemembers, which increases if the force gets significantly smaller without a reduction.</p>\n<em>Watch the FY 2022 budget.</em> The FY 2022 budget will provide a first peek at how the administration views “legacy.” Because there is not much time available to do analysis and reach decisions, the administration might make a few changes in FY 2022 and leave the rest to the FY 2023 budget. That will enable incorporation of the results of the administration’s strategic review. (Publication expected late in 2021 or in early February with the FY 2023 budget.) On the other hand, they may opt for a Gates-like budget stroke that incorporates all the major changes in one package.\n<p>One early warning sign of major change: Watch for officials signing nondisclosure agreements. That was Sec. Gates’s mechanism for ensuring secrecy before revealing the big cut.</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["2022 budget", "CAPE", "carriers", "Cost Assessment Program Evaluation", "drones", "F-15EX", "f-35 joint strike fighter", "fighters", "robotics", "Swarm"], "categories": [], "img_data": [{"img_url": "https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2017/01/F-35C-FA-18E-together-110521-F-KM302-079-1024x683.jpg", "img_describe": "A Navy F-35C (upper left) and Hornet (lower right)", "img_name": "news/img_2021_07_21_60f798e1435cc49f1f88d7ab.png"}], "video_data": [], "url": "https://breakingdefense.com/2021/03/whats-in-a-name-billions-in-cuts-depend-on-defining-legacy/", "site_name": "breakingdefense", "insert_time": "2021-07-21 11:47:45"}

{"title": "Ukraine Turns To West For Fighters; Plans To Drop MiG Fleet", "publish_time": "2021-04-13 16:53:08", "author": ["Reuben Johnson"], "content": "KIEV: Ukraine, faced with Russian troops on two fronts, has gone public with plans to buy combat aircraft that are not Russian-made. The vulnerable NATO partner plans to become independent of Vladimir Putin’s military in a crucial domain.\nUnlike Poland\n, which has been operating a “mixed” fleet of US and Russian-made aircraft, Ukraine is evaluating wholesale replacement of all its Soviet-era MiG-29s and Su-27s. This would make Ukraine a more effective NATO partner, but defense analysts caution there are critical short-term issues which should be a top priority for Washington’s policy-makers.\nBuying US aircraft would enhance Ukraine’s interoperability with NATO, critically important for a nation that has the longest border with Russia. But, say retired western military personnel currently advising Ukraine’s armed forces, DC policymakers will have to commit to an unprecedented level of support for this beleaguered former vassal state of Moscow.\n“The first step is that the US transferring a large tranche of hardware to Ukraine ASAP,” one former UK officer here said. Then, ”there is even more potentially politically unpalatable decision of placing a contingent of US military personnel here in Ukraine to conduct a years-long training program in how to utilize this new hardware – the proverbial ‘boots on the ground.’ Could this provoke Moscow? Yes. But with this country being surrounded by legions of troops and heavy equipment and the Kremlin acting like it is prepping for an invasion, how much worse could the reaction from the Russians be?”\nArming Ukraine with the latest variants of US fighter aircraft will take a long time. A recent op-ed by a long-time US analyst of the Russian military, Stephen Blank, proposes sending Ukraine F-15C/D, E-2C-2000 Hawkeye AWACS, and KC-135R airborne tankers immediately. There are Excess Defense Articles (EDA) aircraft now in storage in the US. The older F-15s could be upgraded (as they are being done for Japan) and later supplemented with new-build F-15EX models.\nUkraine lacks the required financial resources not only to procure these aircraft. It also needs support equipment, smart munitions, cruise missiles such as JASSM. Weaponry would have to be supplied right off a production line or from existing stocks in order to be delivered in an effective time frame. Such a package of materiel provided to Ukraine gratis also might be a hard sell.\nA parallel dilemma is the US effort to prevent sale of the\nUkraine’s Motor Sich aircraft engine\nbusiness in Zaparozhiye to a Chinese firm, Beijing Skyrizon. US intelligence estimates that if China’s defense sector acquires this strategically important technology it would significantly aid their efforts to build more capable fighter aircraft. China still depends on engines imported from Russia. To date the PRC has failed to design reliable power plants on its own.\nUS industry officials tell Breaking Defense that Washington officialdom has pushed them to buy the Motor Sich and take it off the market. But, said one executive, “the same bureaucrats are unaware of the labyrinth of export control regulations that US industry must comply with — regulations that prevent an American firm from acquiring and working with a Ukrainian company.”\nThe French Connection\nA solution for Ukraine to this knotty policy problem may lie in France’s aerospace sector The French are moving faster than Washington and are reportedly ready to propose a tranche of Dassault Rafale fighters to Ukraine. French media have say this sale will be at a priority agenda item when President Macron makes a state visit to Kiev later this year.   “The French president believes in the Rafale’s chances of winning in this former bastion of Russian industry,” reported the French news site Aerotime Hub. “Paris has an advantage: its commercial system capable of supporting such a contract is already in place.” The Rafale would be “85 per cent guaranteed by France, and the French Ministry of the Economy and Finance reportedly already earmarked a budget of €1.5 billion for this purpose.”\nDespite the Ukrainian Air Force’s preference for the US F-15EX, a purchase of the Rafale could carry the day – and solve a vexing problem for Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. There are rumors that Ukraine would be rewarded for buying the Rafale with a pledge that the French aerospace and defense group SAFRAN would acquire Motor Sich. This would keep the business running and its personnel employed, averting a major unemployment headache for the Ukrainian President – and would also please Washington by keeping the company out of Chinese hands.\nAttacking NATO\n’s Weakest Link\nUkraine’s need for new weaponry has been brought into stark relief by recent Russian troop movements in Ukraine’s Donbas region and in Crimea, both invaded and illegally occupied by Moscow more than seven years ago. The Kremlin bills them as exercises, but there are reports of these Russian units now training with groups of pro-Russian separatist forces.\n“As Putin prepares for 19 September parliamentary elections, threatening the invasion of Ukraine takes on added importance,” a former NATO headquarters official told me. “This is attacking NATO’s weakest link – nations (like Ukraine) where there are still many officials with links to Russia.”\nA US failure to make a firm stand in the face of these Russian moves does more than just potentially undermine the credibility of the alliance, a Polish defense analyst says: “It would also disrupt Washington’s efforts to sell American-made hardware to these nations. If Ukraine and others can operate and support US aircraft it becomes markedly easier for a US-NATO force to deploy into these forward areas. Having that infrastructure here in Poland and elsewhere in the region has a deterrent effect all its own.”\nThis is not lost on Moscow. Another nation that has signed to procure US aircraft, Bulgaria, has just broken up a Russian spy ring charged with collecting technical data for Russian intelligence and has booted some of Moscow’s diplomats –a total of five expulsions since October 2019.\nAccording to sources in Bulgaria, the data included information on the F-16V Block 70, the latest-generation model of the F-16 fighter, and its AN/APG-83 AESA radar previously selected for procurement by the Bulgarian Air Force.\n“If Ukraine can be destabilzed by military action before it re-arms, or Bulgaria’s trustworthiness brought into question, Putin can cause immeasurable problems for the Biden administration,” the former NATO official said.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>KIEV: Ukraine, faced with Russian troops on two fronts, has gone public with plans to buy combat aircraft that are not Russian-made. The vulnerable NATO partner plans to become independent of Vladimir Putin’s military in a crucial domain.</p>\n<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/poland/\">Unlike Poland</a>, which has been operating a “mixed” fleet of US and Russian-made aircraft, Ukraine is evaluating wholesale replacement of all its Soviet-era MiG-29s and Su-27s. This would make Ukraine a more effective NATO partner, but defense analysts caution there are critical short-term issues which should be a top priority for Washington’s policy-makers.\n<p>Buying US aircraft would enhance Ukraine’s interoperability with NATO, critically important for a nation that has the longest border with Russia. But, say retired western military personnel currently advising Ukraine’s armed forces, DC policymakers will have to commit to an unprecedented level of support for this beleaguered former vassal state of Moscow.</p>\n\n<p>“The first step is that the US transferring a large tranche of hardware to Ukraine ASAP,” one former UK officer here said. Then, ”there is even more potentially politically unpalatable decision of placing a contingent of US military personnel here in Ukraine to conduct a years-long training program in how to utilize this new hardware – the proverbial ‘boots on the ground.’ Could this provoke Moscow? Yes. But with this country being surrounded by legions of troops and heavy equipment and the Kremlin acting like it is prepping for an invasion, how much worse could the reaction from the Russians be?”</p>\n<p>Arming Ukraine with the latest variants of US fighter aircraft will take a long time. A recent op-ed by a long-time US analyst of the Russian military, Stephen Blank, proposes sending Ukraine F-15C/D, E-2C-2000 Hawkeye AWACS, and KC-135R airborne tankers immediately. There are Excess Defense Articles (EDA) aircraft now in storage in the US. The older F-15s could be upgraded (as they are being done for Japan) and later supplemented with new-build F-15EX models.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine lacks the required financial resources not only to procure these aircraft. It also needs support equipment, smart munitions, cruise missiles such as JASSM. Weaponry would have to be supplied right off a production line or from existing stocks in order to be delivered in an effective time frame. Such a package of materiel provided to Ukraine gratis also might be a hard sell.</p>\n<p>A parallel dilemma is the US effort to prevent sale of the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/motor-sich/\">Ukraine’s Motor Sich aircraft engine</a> business in Zaparozhiye to a Chinese firm, Beijing Skyrizon. US intelligence estimates that if China’s defense sector acquires this strategically important technology it would significantly aid their efforts to build more capable fighter aircraft. China still depends on engines imported from Russia. To date the PRC has failed to design reliable power plants on its own.</p>\n\n \n<p>US industry officials tell Breaking Defense that Washington officialdom has pushed them to buy the Motor Sich and take it off the market. But, said one executive, “the same bureaucrats are unaware of the labyrinth of export control regulations that US industry must comply with — regulations that prevent an American firm from acquiring and working with a Ukrainian company.”</p>\n<p>The French Connection</p>\n<p>A solution for Ukraine to this knotty policy problem may lie in France’s aerospace sector The French are moving faster than Washington and are reportedly ready to propose a tranche of Dassault Rafale fighters to Ukraine. French media have say this sale will be at a priority agenda item when President Macron makes a state visit to Kiev later this year.   “The French president believes in the Rafale’s chances of winning in this former bastion of Russian industry,” reported the French news site Aerotime Hub. “Paris has an advantage: its commercial system capable of supporting such a contract is already in place.” The Rafale would be “85 per cent guaranteed by France, and the French Ministry of the Economy and Finance reportedly already earmarked a budget of €1.5 billion for this purpose.”</p>\n<p>Despite the Ukrainian Air Force’s preference for the US F-15EX, a purchase of the Rafale could carry the day – and solve a vexing problem for Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.

{"title": "China Is Not Outspending US On Defense; ’22 Budget Is Enough", "publish_time": "2021-06-07 19:01:45", "author": ["Lawrence Korb"], "content": "Bill\nGreenwalt argues the US needs to increase\nits current level of defense spending by 3% to 5% a year in real terms, because China, our principal geostrategic competitor, is already outspending us on defense and time is not on our side.\nGreenwalt comes to this conclusion by claiming that in estimating the\nsize of the Chinese defense budget\n, we should not rely on the analysis by such internationally recognized groups as the Stockholm Peace Research Institute (SPRI) or the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), but instead use Purchasing Power Parity (PPP.) On top of that, he says that, when analyzing the size of the US defense budget, we need to eliminate all the money the Pentagon supposedly spends on social programs. Therefore, he concludes that the annual military budget analysis of IISS that the US spends more on defense than the next 13 countries in the world combined, is a trope.\nBut close analysis demonstrates that all of these claims are misleading at best and present a distorted picture of our military spending and that the defense budget of $753 billion, proposed by the Biden administration, for 2022\nis more than enough\n, even though it does not call for a real increase in the level of defense spending over last year’s.\nIn arguing that the Chinese defense budget is actually more than double the SPRI number, Greenwalt employs the same methodology that the defence hawks used in the Cold War. I saw this myself during my early days in the Reagan Pentagon. As we prepared our first defense budget for 1982, and as someone responsible for manpower issues, I argued that we needed to give our troops an across the board increase of 14.3% in their base pay in our upcoming budget. Not surprisingly some of my colleagues in the Pentagon and OMB argued that this amount was too large.\nTo deal with this argument, I made two points. First, 14.3% was the gap between what the Employment Cost Index (ECI) demonstrated that the troops should be receiving and what they were actually getting. Consequently, we were having a difficult time in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified men and women to volunteer for military service.\nSecond, by giving our troops this large a raise, we would increase the gap between our defense budget and that of the Soviet Union. Since the Soviets did not have a normal economic system, the CIA’s annual estimate of Soviet military spending calculated how much it would cost us to purchase and maintain the same size force.\nIn essence, the CIA was using what today we would call PPP to compare the budgets of the two superpowers, a concept that Bill Greenwalt uses to raise the Chinese budget from the SPRI amount of between $184 billion and $252 billion to $518 billion. Therefore, increasing the pay for our force, which was smaller than that of the Soviet Union, would widen the gap and make it politically easier for Reagan to sell his massive defense budget build up. My boss, Secretary Weinberger, who ran OMB for Nixon, quickly dropped his objections to the proposed raise when I presented the case in that manner.\nWe got the large increase in pay for the troops, which helped save the All Volunteer Force (AVF), and this helped Reagan get a massive increase in defense spending in his first administration. But, even with this increase, we never matched the CIA estimate of Soviet military expenditures. Moreover, even after the massive deficit President Reagan ran up in his first term forced him to cut defense spending by 10% (in real dollars) in his second term, we still somehow won the Cold War.\nNot only does Greenwalt argue that the Chinese budget is really more than twice as large as the official estimate, but that there are about $200 billion of non-defense items embedded in the US defense budget such as health care and grocery stores. This argument also fails on at least two accounts\nFirst, most of the items that he, the late Sen. John McCain and current Rep. Anthony Brown, claim should not be part of the defense budget actually should be. For example, the total compensation package for military personnel includes free health care as well as low-cost groceries at commissaries and exchanges for them and their dependents not only while they are on active duty, but when they retire. If DoD did not fund these, basic pay would have to be increased dramatically\nIn addition Greenwalt’s analysis ignores the fact that there are significant expenditures outside of the annual defense budget that could and should be part of it. For example, the US Treasury Department currently spends over $100 billion a year on the amortization of unfunded liabilities in the military retirement and healthcare funds, which until the mid 1980s were funded annually by the Department of Defense. It was moved out of the defense budget by Congress on the condition that the Pentagon would reduce the retirement amount from 50% to 40% for those eligible for retirement pay. However, after a decade the Pentagon returned to 50%, giving DoD the best of both worlds and letting Treasury pick up the bill.\nSimilarly, much of the $260 billion annual budget of the Veterans Administration (VA) goes for items like health care for military retirees and education benefits, which is an excellent recruiting tool, and also saves the Pentagon substantial sums.\nWhile the US, as Greenwalt points out, spends 16 times as much on its military recruits as China, are not our troops much better than their Chinese counterparts, who receive an average of $30,000 a year, which is less than half of what our troops get? Moreover, even with our smaller budget, the US has 20 times the number of nuclear warheads as China, three times the number of modern fighter jets, twice the tonnage of warships at sea, three times as many modern fighter jets, 800 overseas bases compared to China’s 3, and spends twice as much of GDP on defense as China.\nEven if one accepts Greenwalt’s argument that the claim that the US spends more then the next 13 countries in the world combined is a trope, the fact of the matter is that most of those other countries on the list are US allies or friendly countries.\nA much better comparison\nfor determining whether we need to increase or decrease defense spending is to compare, in real terms, what we spent during the Reagan buildup or the peaks of the Korea and Vietnam Wars to our current level. Doing so shows that $753 billion, which is the proposed budget of the Biden administration for 2022, is substantially higher.

On top of that, he says that, when analyzing the size of the US defense budget, we need to eliminate all the money the Pentagon supposedly spends on social programs. Therefore, he concludes that the annual military budget analysis of IISS that the US spends more on defense than the next 13 countries in the world combined, is a trope.</p>\n\n<p>But close analysis demonstrates that all of these claims are misleading at best and present a distorted picture of our military spending and that the defense budget of $753 billion, proposed by the Biden administration, for 2022<a href=\"https://fareedzakaria.com/columns/2021/3/18/the-pentagon-is-using-china-as-an-excuse-for-huge-new-budgets\"> is more than enough</a>, even though it does not call for a real increase in the level of defense spending over last year’s.</p>\n<p>In arguing that the Chinese defense budget is actually more than double the SPRI number, Greenwalt employs the same methodology that the defence hawks used in the Cold War. I saw this myself during my early days in the Reagan Pentagon. As we prepared our first defense budget for 1982, and as someone responsible for manpower issues, I argued that we needed to give our troops an across the board increase of 14.3% in their base pay in our upcoming budget. Not surprisingly some of my colleagues in the Pentagon and OMB argued that this amount was too large.</p>\n<p>To deal with this argument, I made two points. First, 14.3% was the gap between what the Employment Cost Index (ECI) demonstrated that the troops should be receiving and what they were actually getting. Consequently, we were having a difficult time in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified men and women to volunteer for military service.</p>\n<p>Second, by giving our troops this large a raise, we would increase the gap between our defense budget and that of the Soviet Union. Since the Soviets did not have a normal economic system, the CIA’s annual estimate of Soviet military spending calculated how much it would cost us to purchase and maintain the same size force.</p>\n<p>In essence, the CIA was using what today we would call PPP to compare the budgets of the two superpowers, a concept that Bill Greenwalt uses to raise the Chinese budget from the SPRI amount of between $184 billion and $252 billion to $518 billion. Therefore, increasing the pay for our force, which was smaller than that of the Soviet Union, would widen the gap and make it politically easier for Reagan to sell his massive defense budget build up. My boss, Secretary Weinberger, who ran OMB for Nixon, quickly dropped his objections to the proposed raise when I presented the case in that manner.</p>\n<p>We got the large increase in pay for the troops, which helped save the All Volunteer Force (AVF), and this helped Reagan get a massive increase in defense spending in his first administration. But, even with this increase, we never matched the CIA estimate of Soviet military expenditures. Moreover, even after the massive deficit President Reagan ran up in his first term forced him to cut defense spending by 10% (in real dollars) in his second term, we still somehow won the Cold War.</p>\n<p>Not only does Greenwalt argue that the Chinese budget is really more than twice as large as the official estimate, but that there are about $200 billion of non-defense items embedded in the US defense budget such as health care and grocery stores. This argument also fails on at least two accounts</p>\n<p>First, most of the items that he, the late Sen. John McCain and current Rep. Anthony Brown, claim should not be part of the defense budget actually should be. For example, the total compensation package for military personnel includes free health care as well as low-cost groceries at commissaries and exchanges for them and their dependents not only while they are on active duty, but when they retire. If DoD did not fund these, basic pay would have to be increased dramatically</p>\n<p>In addition Greenwalt’s analysis ignores the fact that there are significant expenditures outside of the annual defense budget that could and should be part of it. For example, the US Treasury Department currently spends over $100 billion a year on the amortization of unfunded liabilities in the military retirement and healthcare funds, which until the mid 1980s were funded annually by the Department of Defense. It was moved out of the defense budget by Congress on the condition that the Pentagon would reduce the retirement amount from 50% to 40% for those eligible for retirement pay. However, after a decade the Pentagon returned to 50%, giving DoD the best of both worlds and letting Treasury pick up the bill.</p>\n<p>Similarly, much of the $260 billion annual budget of the Veterans Administration (VA) goes for items like health care for military retirees and education benefits, which is an excellent recruiting tool, and also saves the Pentagon substantial sums.</p>\n<p>While the US, as Greenwalt points out, spends 16 times as much on its military recruits as China, are not our troops much better than their Chinese counterparts, who receive an average of $30,000 a year, which is less than half of what our troops get? Moreover, even with our smaller budget, the US has 20 times the number of nuclear warheads as China, three times the number of modern fighter jets, twice the tonnage of warships at sea, three times as many modern fighter jets, 800 overseas bases compared to China’s 3, and spends twice as much of GDP on defense as China.</p>\n<p>Even if one accepts Greenwalt’s argument that the claim that the US spends more then the next 13 countries in the world combined is a trope, the fact of the matter is that most of those other countries on the list are US allies or friendly countries.</p>\n<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/2022-budget/\">A much better comparison</a> for determining whether we need to increase or decrease defense spending is to compare, in real terms, what we spent during the Reagan buildup or the peaks of the Korea and Vietnam Wars to our current level. Doing so shows that $753 billion, which is the proposed budget of the Biden administration for 2022, is substantially higher. While there is no doubt that Chinese military power is increasing, it is still nowhere close to that of the former Soviet Union, and somehow we won the Cold War even though the Soviets theoretically outspent us.\n<p>Moreover, the Reagan defense buildup was needed because of the severe cuts in defense spending in the 1970s, primarily by the Nixon administration. Biden is inheriting a defense budget that Trump increased by $100 billion over his four years in office.

The company said SUNSHUTTLE has a “possible connection to\nUNC2452\n” — the name FireEye has given to a threat actor associated with the SolarWinds campaign.\nNakasone made the remarks during his opening keynote speech at the eighth\nCYBERCOM Annual Legal Conference\n, which was held virtually for the first time this year due to COVID-19 and had over 1,400 attendees from around the world, including 200 foreign partners. In addition to leading CYBERCOM, Nakasone currently serves as the Director of the National Security Agency and as Chief of the Central Security Service.\nNakasone did not detail what CYBERCOM’s “key role” or the “ongoing response” is to the SolarWinds hack, but he highlighted supporting the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Office of the Director of National Intelligence. CYBERCOM’s broad mission includes protecting Department of Defense networks, guarding the nation against cyberattacks, and supporting Joint Forces. His speech placed notable emphasis on CYBERCOM’s “defend forward” concept. Nakasone said defend forward includes “executing operations outside U.S. military networks.”\nMeanwhile, FireEye’s Mandiant Threat Intelligence team said it found SUNSHUTTLE “uploaded by a U.S.-based entity to a public malware repository in August 2020.” It did not name the entity, but this might be the “possible connection” to UNC2452 that Mandiant refers to. Mandiant characterized SUNSHUTTLE as “most likely a second-stage backdoor dropped after an initial compromise.” SUNSHUTTLE includes standard malware capabilities, including communication with remote servers controlled by the threat actor who can use them to remotely change the malware’s configuration, upload/download files, and execute arbitrary commands on a compromised asset.

Act entails “hunt forward” — that is, proactively identifying security vulnerabilities in partners’ networks overseas, with permission — as well as offensive operations and information operations. Within CYBERCOM’s strategy, offensive operations could mean retaliatory or preemptive cyber measures taken against adversaries in order to protect the U.S. “Persistent engagement,” he said, “focuses on an aggressor’s confidence and capabilities by countering and contesting campaigns short of armed conflict.”\nNakasone noted that “Great Power competition lives in cyberspace.” He said China is “the most strategic adversary” while Russia remains “the most sophisticated adversary” in cyberspace.

Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON:\nA recent Army aviation exercise called EDGE21\nwas a two-week workout for key technologies ahead of the service’s flagship\nProject Convergence wargames\n, generals told reporters this morning. The technologies field-tested at Dugway Proving Grounds in Yuma ranged from jamming pods to infantry goggles to drone controls — all made possible by a prototype\nModular Open Systems Architecture\n, the\ninvisible, digital backbone\nof the Army’s future air fleet.\nMOSA is the Army’s emerging set of common standards and interfaces for aircraft electronics. (There’s\nan even more nascent standard emerging to link air and ground\n). While MOSA will come into full effect on the Army’s\nFuture Vertical Lift\naircraft, early versions are being retrofitted on existing aircraft, notably on the Army version of the Predator drone, the\nMQ-1C Grey Eagle\n.\nMOSA enables aircraft to “rapidly… plug and play” a host of upgrades, from jamming pods to munitions, without the usual laborious modification process, explained\nMaj. Gen. David Francis\n, commander of the Army\nAviation Center of Excellence\n. That kind of flexibility and adaptability, he said, is key to keeping up with high-tech adversaries in\nfuture multi-domain operations\nacross land, air, sea, space, and cyberspace.\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if some of our pods that we’re working on are able to get out to the force years sooner because of [MOSA],” said Maj. Gen. Walter Rugen, Army Futures Command’s\ndirector for Future Vertical Lift\n.\nJamming Pods\nA critical case in point is a pair of new jamming pods integrated on the MOSA-equipped Grey Eagles. One pod came from the Army’s airborne electronic warfare program of record,\nMFEW-Air\n, which is now running “months and months” ahead of schedule, Rugen told reporters. The other came from a program too sensitive to name in public, but, he said, “we were very happy with what we saw.”\nThe Army had neglected\nlong-range electronic warfare\nsince the Cold War, especially amidst the urgency for short-range jamming of roadside bombs in Afghanistan and Iraq. But EW is a major strength of Russia and China, and a critical weakness for a US military increasingly reliant on radio networks.\nElectronic warfare systems “had a much larger role [in EDGE21] than what we’ve seen in the past,” Rugen said, jamming Air Force emitters simulating enemy transmissions. The bad guys didn’t try to jam back in this exercise, but\nthey will in Project Convergence\n.\nWhile he can’t divulge many details about electronic warfare, Rugen said, “we’re probably going to raise the bar going into PC 21, because of the number of successes we saw out there at Dugway.”\nInfantry Goggles\nMOSA also helped link 82\nnd\nAirborne soldiers aboard helicopters to their division command post 100 kilometers (62 miles) away, Rugen said. The soldiers were conducting a classic airborne mission, a\nheliborne air assault on a remote target\n, while wearing a brand-new technology, Microsoft’s\nIntegrated Visual Augmentation System\n. The IVAS goggles use augmented reality to project a wide range of data on the wearer’s field of vision, from cross-hairs showing where your gun is aimed, to friendly positions, to live\nfeeds from drones\n.\nConnectivity is the Achilles’ heel of such networked systems, but in EDGE21, the lieutenant leading the air assault platoon was able to stay connected “seamlessly” as he moved on and off the Black Hawk (which was equipped with its own local wifi network). The infantry passengers in the back of the aircraft were able to share data with the aircrew in flight (who used tablets, not goggles). The unit make adjustments to their plan en route based on the latest intelligence – and keep the division command post (the TAC) informed while they were doing it.\nData flowed back and forth between different systems, like the frontline WINTAK and the command post’s CPCE, and different levels of classification, from top secret to secure-but-unclassified. Target detections from highly classified “strategic ISR assets” (i.e. spy satellites) flowed swiftly to systems that could use it, from artillery batteries and jamming pods to the infantry platoon leader.\nInstead of providing bandwidth-hogging full motion video, however, the Army has simplified target reports to “chipsets,” basically a picture of the target with its coordinates. That streamlined nugget of data is much easier to transmit to frontline soldiers at\nthe fraying edge of the Army’s tactical network\n.\nThe 82\nnd\nwill conducted a similar network-enabled air assault\nin Project Convergence\n, the Army has said.\nDrone & Helicopters\nThe ground troops could also use MOSA-enabled connections to take over nearby drones and task them for reconnaissance missions. Known as\nthe Scalable Control Interface\n, the system turns the standard\nAndroid/Windows Tactical Assault Kit\nsoftware on infantry leaders’ handheld devices into a universal drone controller.\n“Basically, this is the ability for anyone on the battlefield with this ATAK or WINTAK device [to] grab control of every unmanned system we had out there,” Rugen said. (Presumably, in a future network, some kind of artificial intelligence would rapidly adjudicate priorities in case of competing claims to the same drone). The 82\nnd\nplatoon leader, for instance, could take over everything from\nAir Launched Effects mini-drones\nto a\nnearly-two-ton\nGrey Eagle.\nIn Project Convergence, the Army will ramp things up by using the same Scalable Control Interface to let soldiers control an UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter conducting an emergency supply run. The remote-controlled chopper –\na DARPA-Sikorsky project called ALIAS\n– will have a human safety pilot aboard just in case, but it’ll fly entirely on its own, obedient to directions from the ground.\nProject Convergence will also include new aviation technologies not tried out at EDGE 21, however. That includes two new weapons systems that will eventually go on the Army’s new scout helicopter, the\nFuture Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft\n. One is a relatively straightforward 20 mm cannon. The other is a kind of lethal USB port known as a\nModular Effects Launcher\n, whose slots are compatible with both weapons systems – rockets, Hellfire missiles, JAGM, Spike – and electronics – like a radar or a jamming pod.\n“We will be shaking that out in PC21,” Rugen said. “It’s a further advancement of this whole\nopen system approach\nwhere we want commanders to have a flexibility that we’ve never achieved before.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/02/exclusive-army-airpower-to-strike-deep-in-edge21-war-game/\">A recent Army aviation exercise called EDGE21</a> was a two-week workout for key technologies ahead of the service’s flagship <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/joint-force-vs-china-project-convergence-21/\">Project Convergence wargames</a>, generals told reporters this morning.

That’s why the Army — which runs JLTV on behalf of all the US armed services and seven foreign customers from\nBelgium\nto Brazil — had to issue the new contract this fall.\nYou see, in 2015, when\nOshkosh beat aerospace titan Lockheed Martin and Humvee manufacturer AM General\n, the Army issued a production contract with a maximum value of\n$6.7 billion\nand a maximum quantity of\n16,901 vehicles\n. That contract was supposed to last eight years, through 2022. Before it ran out, the Army would hold a new competition, open to all comers, with the winner – perhaps Oshkosh, perhaps a rival – getting a new contract to build JLTVs after 2022.\nBut Oshkosh kept selling JLTVs more cheaply than the 2015 contract had assumed. That meant the military could buy more vehicles more quickly, even with\na reduced budget for JLTV\n. That meant, in turn, that it ran up against the 2015 contract’s 16,901-vehicle maximum\nthis fall\n, two years ahead of schedule.\nSo, to keep production going, the Army issued the new contract: an additional $911 million for 2,738 more JLTVs, plus 1,001 trailers and other kit. That brings the total on order to 18,073 JLTVs, of which over half – about 9,500 – have already been delivered.\nWhat does a JLTV cost? That’s tricky. Oshkosh doesn’t divulge exact prices. The government’s estimated Average Procurement Unit Cost per JLTV is\n$395,000\n(once adjusted for inflation; it’s\n$365,000\nin 2015 dollars). If you just divide the dollar value of the new contract by the number of vehicles, the average cost per JLTV has fallen below $333,000. But the actual price per JLTV is actually a lot lower than that, because these contracts always include trailers, specialized mission equipment for different JLTV variants, spare parts and support.\nThe new contract allows the Army to order additional JLTVs through November 2023. That keeps production going through the re-competition, which is scheduled to award a contract in the second half of 2022.\nNow, the re-compete is\nnot\nabout picking a new design. Instead, it’s about giving the Army the option to pick a new\nmanufacturer\nfor the\nexisting\ndesign. Under the terms of the original 2015 contract,\nthe government bought the Technical Data Package\nthat shows you how to build a JLTV and can give that data to any company it likes. In fact, several potential competitors have not only gotten the data package, they’ve actually leased JLTVs so they can reverse-engineer them.\nBut while competitors now have the JLTV\ndesign\n, they don’t have Oshkosh’s facilities, workforce or their years of experience actually building it.\n“We’ve been manufacturing this vehicle for five years,” Mansfield told me. “We know how it’s designed because we designed it, we know how to manufacture it, we’ve got a strong supply base. So I think we’re in a very good position.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The Army’s already shared Oshkosh’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/02/army-will-share-oshkoshs-jltv-designs-with-competitors/\">Joint Light Tactical Vehicle design</a> with rival companies, who hope to take over the program when <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/02/army-seeks-new-jltv-competition-in-2022/\">a new competition is held in 2022</a>.

Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: Unlike\nrival Rheinmetall\nwith its sleek\nLynx armored vehicle\n,\nGeneral Dynamics\ndoesn’t know what its\nproposed replacement for the M2 Bradley\nwould look like. But that’s exactly according to plan.\nAt this early stage\nin its\nOptionally Manned Fighting Vehicle\nprogram, the Army is not\nasking\nfor a detailed design, or even a rough concept for a\nspecific\nvehicle. Instead, General Dynamics OMFV director Ray Kiernan told me in an interview, the Army wants companies to come up with a flexible\napproach\nthat explores a wide range of possibilities – the state of the art and the art of the possible in armored vehicle design.\nThose studies, in turn, will help the Army turn\nits current broad “characteristics”\ninto specific performance requirements. Once the Army has specific requirements, then the competing companies can produce specific designs to meet them.\nBut right now,\nthe Army wants to consider the full range of options\n, from a souped-up Bradley carrying five or six infantry passengers, to a massive machine carrying 30 infantry, to a mini-tank carrying just one. “You could have solutions across that whole spectrum,” Kiernan told me. “What we believe General Dynamics’ role to [be] is to apply our tools to help the Army understand where the optimal solution lies within that trade space.”\nThat stands in stark contrast to the Army’s initial, cancelled attempt to build OMFV. Back in 2020, the service laid out rigid requirements, then demanded companies deliver a fully functioning prototype at their own expense. In the end, only General Dynamics delivered a prototype by the deadline – only for it\nnot to meet the requirements\n,\nwhich the Army later admitted were unrealistic\n. So, in a bold move, the service rebooted the entire OMFV program with a more realistic schedule, broad “characteristics” instead of requirements, and an entirely new approach to competition.\nThis time around, the Army isn’t asking companies to build a vehicle, not yet. Instead, “we need to build the system models,” said Kiernan. “We need to do the trade studies to analyze the various technology options and how they fit together to make a balanced solution.”\nAI, Electronics, & Open Architecture\nWhile the Army’s keeping its options open, certain unifying themes are already clear – technologies that any solution must include to meet the Army’s requirements. Most obviously, as the name Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle implies, the Army wants\nextensive automation to supplement the human crew\n– or, for some missions, to replace them.\nMore broadly, OMFV must accommodate a host of highly sophisticated electronics, from sensors and targeting systems to network communications to share threat and target data across the force – all enabled by artificial intelligence. OMFV must be able to update that hardware and software rapidly as technology advances and threats mutate, using what’s called\nmodular open system architecture\nto enable plug-and-play insertions of new tech — including technologies not even envisioned today. And all of this must be resilient against cyber attack and electronic jamming.\n“If you don’t establish those things as a fundamental part of your vehicle up front and really build the vehicles around those capabilities in an open architecture,” Kiernan said, “you’re going to struggle to really deliver the kind of transformational capability that the Army wants.”\nTo pull in all the necessary expertise, General Dynamics Land Systems has brought together a wide-ranging — even eclectic — team of companies:\nApplied Intuition\nis not a traditional defense contractor. It builds software to test and develop autonomous vehicles, with a focus on the market for civilian self-driving cars. ”They’re really a market leader in autonomy and artificial intelligence, as well as modeling and simulation, [to] revolutionize how transportation technologies can be applied,” Kiernan said. “Non-traditional for the defense world, but they bring us a lot of artificial intelligence expertise.”\nAeroVironment\nis a defense contractor, but not a traditional ground vehicle company: They’re most famous for\nsmall drones\n, from the Army’s hand-launched Raven scout, to the Jump-20 VTOL drone, to the Switchblade loitering munition. AeroVironment teamed with General Dynamics to\nlaunch its mini-drones from GD’s vehicles\n, giving each vehicle commander his own personal eye in the sky – and perhaps the capability to launch short-range airstrikes as well.\nGeneral Dynamics Missions Systems\nis basically the electronics division of GD. For OMFV, Kiernan said, Mission Systems brings expertise in battle management systems, cybersecurity, and sensor integration.\nFinally, there’s General Dynamics Land Systems itself, most famous for building, sustaining, and repeatedly upgrading the Reagan-era\nM1 Abrams\nat its Lima tank plant. Decades of improvements to the M1 have taught GDLS a lot about what it takes to keep an Army vehicle cutting-edge over time, Kiernan said. Meanwhile, work on the Army’s 8×8\nStryker\n, the prototype\nMobile Protected Firepower\n(MPF) light tank, and Britain’s\nAjax family of vehicles\nhave kept GDLS in the business of building new designs as well.\nGDLS also built a\nseries of concept vehicles\n, sometimes known as Griffin, that gave rise to both its MPF design and its offering for the initial version of OMFV. While that competition was canceled, Kiernan says Griffin and other past projects are still highly relevant for the rebooted OMFV program. Technologies includes the\n50 mm autocannon featured on Griffin III\n, which is one potential armament option for OMFV, and extensive work on automotive components, automation, open architecture, and electrical systems to power modern electronics.\n“We have a wealth of information from the investments we’ve done,” Kiernan said. “It provides us with a very unique set of data that acts as a starting point when we start to explore the trade space.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: Unlike <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/l3harris-joins-rheinmetalls-team-lynx-for-army-omfv/\">rival Rheinmetall</a> with its sleek <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/10/lynx-strikes-back-how-rheinmetall-could-win-army-omfv-analysis/\">Lynx armored vehicle</a>, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/omfv-army-gets-bae-bradley-replacement-design/\">General Dynamics</a> doesn’t know what its <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/faster-tougher-smarter-armys-future-armored-force-exclusive/\">proposed replacement for the M2 Bradley</a> would look like.

{"title": "Abu Dhabi Defense Shows Highlight New Products, Partnerships", "publish_time": "2021-02-26 22:47:45", "author": ["Chyrine Mezher"], "content": "ABU DHABI\n: The\nInternational Defense Exhibition and Naval Defense Exhibitions\n(IDEX and NAVDEX 2021) have seen extensive participation and $5.7 billion in deals over the last five days.\nThe first global defense show to take place in the post-pandemic recovery stage attracted more than 62,000 attendees, 900 exhibitors, 59 countries, and 35 international pavilions.\n“This edition has been nothing short of exceptional,” said Maj. Gen. Staff Pilot Faris Khalaf Al Mazrouei, chairman of the Higher Organizing Committee said at a press briefing. “That union has enabled our nation to cultivate and expand our defense infrastructure and technological systems, using them to ensure security and peace across the Middle East.”\nThe foremost achievement of this edition, however, was the rigorous implementation of all precautionary COVID-19 health measures.\n“IDEX and NAVDEX 2021 enabled the return of the national business tourism sector, alongside continuing to support the UAE’s defence industry and ensured that UAE products are globally competitively, both meeting the needs of the nation alongside reaching new markets,” he added.\nDuring the first four days of the exhibitions, 98% of participants and visitors said they were satisfied with the preventative and precautionary measures implemented, while 99% of participants stated they felt safe inside the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company (ADNEC).\n“Doubtlessly, these figures demonstrate the accomplishment of this edition,” said Humaid Matar Al Dhaheri, managing director and group CEO of ADNEC. “Lessons learnt here will support the wider resurgence of the business tourism sector, both at a local and international level.”\nAmong the defense deals announced here, French Nexter Systems will provide spare parts to Leclerc tanks for the Emirati General Maintenance Corps Command; Abu Dhabi Autonomous System Investments will provide a drone system, launch pads, and ground control units for the Presidential Guard Command; International Golden Group will provide weapons and ammunitions to the armed forces and Boeing to provide maintenance services for the C-17 simulators for the Air Force and Air Defense Command.\nStealing the show was UAE’s EDGE Group and its subsidiaries in unmanned aerial and land vehicles fields.\nADASI, the end-to-end solution provider within the autonomous systems industry, unveiled its first family of multirotor loitering munitions, the QX range.\n“The QX-1, QX-2 and QX-3 are quadcopters and QX-4 is a fixed-wing vertical-takeoff-and-landing UAV” senior business development manager Mohamed Abdullah Al Nuaimi, told Breaking Defense. “We integrated explosive payloads inside these systems, respectively 0.5 Kg, 1.5 Kg, 6Kg and 5Kg,” he added.\nEach aircraft have different ranges and endurance. “They range up from 10 to 40km with the endurance ranging from 20 to 90 minutes and can give their troops a better field advantage in areas where GPS is denied,” Al Nuaimi explained.\nThe precision-guided systems use sophisticated AI algorithms to target and strike, boasting an accuracy of 1 m CEP (circular error probable) – with an aim like laser guided munitions. They are currently under development and the company plans to start production by the end of this year. Explosives to the systems will be provided by Halcon, another part of EDGE.\nThe company also showed off its Shadow 50 and Shadow 25 drones, its Rash 2 gliding munition kit, and new variants of the RW-24 drone, securing a $15 million contract to supply Rash 2 to the UAE Armed Forces, marking the first order of the new product.\nADASI has also collaborated with\nNimr\n, its sister company within EDGE Group to convert the Ajban 440A armored vehicle into an unmanned system dubbed the Ajban armed robotic vehicle. It withstands small arms fire, artillery shell splinters and survives mine and improvised explosive device blasts and has a payload capacity of 1,200kg.\n“Improving military fleet capabilities is an operational priority,” CEO Abri du Plessis told\nBreaking Defense\n. “To protect soldiers and maximize their impact, we are making progressive strides toward the introduction of autonomous systems in tactical vehicles in an effort to remove the risk faced by soldiers in volatile missions.”\nNimr is also joining forces with Singapore’s ST Engineering to build hybrid electric drive systems that can be used in armored vehicles, making it the first manufacturer in the region to achieve such a milestone. “This collaboration highlights our commitment to optimizing synergies,” the CEO told me.\nAnother significant aspect of the show was highlighted through strategic partnerships between local and international entities. Leading the way was Tawazun Economic Council who inked multiple agreements, most importantly with Saab and Thales.\nSaab will carry out research and development in the UAE on sensor systems, as well as participate in the Sustain and Enhance Emiratization in Defense and Security (SEEDS) program.\n“It is Saab’s strategy to partner with top companies in the region, and this is our key factor to success,” Anna-Karin Rosén, Managing Director of Saab Ltd. in the UAE told me in an interview.\n“We have the same approach here in the UAE as we do internationally, and the agreement with Tawazun is an example of that. I am a very firm believer in the strength of having industry working together with government entities and we are actively pursuing these kinds of relationships in the UAE.”\nTawazun and Thales Emarat Technologies, have also announced the launch of a Radar Center of Excellence.

Gen. Staff Pilot Faris Khalaf Al Mazrouei, chairman of the Higher Organizing Committee said at a press briefing. “That union has enabled our nation to cultivate and expand our defense infrastructure and technological systems, using them to ensure security and peace across the Middle East.”</p>\n\n<p>The foremost achievement of this edition, however, was the rigorous implementation of all precautionary COVID-19 health measures.</p>\n<p>“IDEX and NAVDEX 2021 enabled the return of the national business tourism sector, alongside continuing to support the UAE’s defence industry and ensured that UAE products are globally competitively, both meeting the needs of the nation alongside reaching new markets,” he added.</p>\n\n<p>During the first four days of the exhibitions, 98% of participants and visitors said they were satisfied with the preventative and precautionary measures implemented, while 99% of participants stated they felt safe inside the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company (ADNEC).</p>\n<p>“Doubtlessly, these figures demonstrate the accomplishment of this edition,” said Humaid Matar Al Dhaheri, managing director and group CEO of ADNEC. “Lessons learnt here will support the wider resurgence of the business tourism sector, both at a local and international level.”</p>\n\n \n<p>Among the defense deals announced here, French Nexter Systems will provide spare parts to Leclerc tanks for the Emirati General Maintenance Corps Command; Abu Dhabi Autonomous System Investments will provide a drone system, launch pads, and ground control units for the Presidential Guard Command; International Golden Group will provide weapons and ammunitions to the armed forces and Boeing to provide maintenance services for the C-17 simulators for the Air Force and Air Defense Command.</p>\n<p>Stealing the show was UAE’s EDGE Group and its subsidiaries in unmanned aerial and land vehicles fields.</p>\n<p>ADASI, the end-to-end solution provider within the autonomous systems industry, unveiled its first family of multirotor loitering munitions, the QX range.</p>\n<p>“The QX-1, QX-2 and QX-3 are quadcopters and QX-4 is a fixed-wing vertical-takeoff-and-landing UAV” senior business development manager Mohamed Abdullah Al Nuaimi, told Breaking Defense. “We integrated explosive payloads inside these systems, respectively 0.5 Kg, 1.5 Kg, 6Kg and 5Kg,” he added.</p>\n<p>Each aircraft have different ranges and endurance. “They range up from 10 to 40km with the endurance ranging from 20 to 90 minutes and can give their troops a better field advantage in areas where GPS is denied,” Al Nuaimi explained.</p>\n<p>The precision-guided systems use sophisticated AI algorithms to target and strike, boasting an accuracy of 1 m CEP (circular error probable) – with an aim like laser guided munitions. They are currently under development and the company plans to start production by the end of this year. Explosives to the systems will be provided by Halcon, another part of EDGE.</p>\n<p>The company also showed off its Shadow 50 and Shadow 25 drones, its Rash 2 gliding munition kit, and new variants of the RW-24 drone, securing a $15 million contract to supply Rash 2 to the UAE Armed Forces, marking the first order of the new product.</p>\n<p>ADASI has also collaborated with <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/02/uae-saudis-team-on-armored-vehicles-for-kingdom-precedent-setting-deal/\">Nimr</a>, its sister company within EDGE Group to convert the Ajban 440A armored vehicle into an unmanned system dubbed the Ajban armed robotic vehicle. It withstands small arms fire, artillery shell splinters and survives mine and improvised explosive device blasts and has a payload capacity of 1,200kg.</p>\n<p>“Improving military fleet capabilities is an operational priority,” CEO Abri du Plessis told <em>Breaking Defense</em>. “To protect soldiers and maximize their impact, we are making progressive strides toward the introduction of autonomous systems in tactical vehicles in an effort to remove the risk faced by soldiers in volatile missions.”</p>\n<p>Nimr is also joining forces with Singapore’s ST Engineering to build hybrid electric drive systems that can be used in armored vehicles, making it the first manufacturer in the region to achieve such a milestone. “This collaboration highlights our commitment to optimizing synergies,” the CEO told me.</p>\n<p>Another significant aspect of the show was highlighted through strategic partnerships between local and international entities. Leading the way was Tawazun Economic Council who inked multiple agreements, most importantly with Saab and Thales.</p>\n<p>Saab will carry out research and development in the UAE on sensor systems, as well as participate in the Sustain and Enhance Emiratization in Defense and Security (SEEDS) program.</p>\n<p>“It is Saab’s strategy to partner with top companies in the region, and this is our key factor to success,” Anna-Karin Rosén, Managing Director of Saab Ltd. in the UAE told me in an interview.</p>\n<p>“We have the same approach here in the UAE as we do internationally, and the agreement with Tawazun is an example of that. I am a very firm believer in the strength of having industry working together with government entities and we are actively pursuing these kinds of relationships in the UAE.”</p>\n<p>Tawazun and Thales Emarat Technologies, have also announced the launch of a Radar Center of Excellence.

The UCS gets something wrong at every step of their analysis, they say.\nThe study,\nreleased\ndays before President Biden’s inauguration and touted in\nThe New York Times\n, argues that the investment for\nhypersonics\nis out of all proportion to the strategic benefits.\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists\nargues\nthat hypersonics aren’t the unstoppably fast superweapons that they are often described as, not only in news stories but even in serious academic articles. So, at about $3.2 billion in R&D for 2021 alone, “the current number is pretty excessive, based on what we know about the performance, what these can do relative to what the weapons we already have,”\nCameron Tracy\n, the lead author of the UCS study, told me. “We’re not really arguing against\nresearch\non hypersonic flight, [but for] a significant reduction in funding for\ndevelopment\nof these weapons.”\nBut that conclusion is built upon a fatally flawed analytical foundation, argue our sources in the Pentagon and defense thinktanks.\n“The [UCS] analysis compares intercontinental ballistic missiles to hypersonic glide bodies, and the authors then make the conclusion that hypersonic glide bodies don’t offer much benefit for that mission, because they don’t significantly reduce time to target and they can theoretically be detected,” Michael White, the principal director for hypersonics in the Pentagon\nundersecretariat\nfor research & engineering, told me. “But for that mission, the fact that you get there five or 10 minutes faster is not the value proposition, and just because you can detect an incoming hypersonic missile that does not mean you can shoot it down or determine where it is going to impact.\n“The key attribute for a hypersonic weapon is the trajectory uncertainty due to maneuverability enabled by high speed flight within the atmosphere,” he said.\nIn other words, the primary reason Russia and China want hypersonic weapons is that they’re extremely hard to intercept, even more so than ballistic missiles. Moscow has been paranoid about US missile defenses neutralizing their nuclear arsenal at least since Ronald Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative back in\n1983\n, even though “Star Wars” never materialized. Beijing has a relatively small ICBM arsenal, so they keep a careful eye on any improvements to America’s current, very limited ballistic missile defense.\n“Their math is relatively simplistic and their assumptions are wrong,” one senior defense official told us, “and they’ve done analysis in a [mission] that’s irrelevant to the DoD investment strategy.”\n“Their criticisms of some claims surrounding hypersonic weapons are accurate, but the subset of claims they chose to address were among the least compelling ones,” Bryan Clark, a retired\nNavy strategist and submariner\nnow with the Hudson Institute, said.\n“In several respects, the authors set up a straw man and then demolish it,” Tom Mahnken, a\nformer defense official and Navy veteran\nwho now heads the Center for Strategic & Budgetary Assessments, argued. “The authors are looking at one particular case:\nintercontinental\nboost-glide vehicles...but I don’t know many folks who envision the US, Russia, or China investing in large numbers of intercontinental hypersonic boost-glide vehicles.”\n“I don’t think you can use this analysis to draw broader conclusions about the types of shorter-range, conventionally-armed hypersonic weapons that states are also investing in,” agreed CSBA scholar\nEvan Montgomery\n.\nAnd those shorter-range hypersonic missiles are what the US is actually building,\nnot\nintercontinental weapons.\n“What we are doing is developing\na family of air, land, and sea-launched,\ntheater-range\n,\nconventionally armed\nsystems\nto defeat targets of critical importance so that we can maintain tactical battlefield dominance in a high-end fight,” said White.\n“In the theater mission, when we look at comparing a long-range strike with a traditional subsonic cruise missile, to that same mission using a hypersonic glide vehicle or cruise missile, the speed difference is a factor of at least 10,” White said. “So instead of taking two hours to fly the route, we can get there in 12 minutes.”\nWith that kind of speed, and a range that – while shorter than ICBMs, is longer than many existing US missiles – theater hypersonics can perform time-critical strike missions that US forces simply can’t do today.\nNow, Russia and China\nare\ndeveloping intercontinental hypersonics – so does the UCS analysis apply to those weapons?\nTo an extent, said CSBA’s Montgomery. “If those weapons are not as fast as, and more detectable than, sometimes portrayed, that should probably limit concerns about the risk they pose,” he told me. “If the technical analysis is correct, then it would suggest hypersonic weapons are unlikely to seriously erode strategic stability.”\nThe US has no such anxieties about its ICBMs being countered. But it sees\ntheater\nhypersonics as a way to penetrate\ntheater\nair and missile defenses that could keep its current missiles, fighters, and bombers at bay in a\nconventional\nconflict.\n“The warfighting effect of these capabilities is transformational,” White said. “We’ve done the analysis, and fighting the tactical fight with and without them, there’s a huge difference.”\nClick here to read Part II of this story, where we go into these claims and counter-claims in depth – from the moment a hypersonic missile is launched to the moment of impact.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The Pentagon’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/michael-white/\">director</a> for hypersonics R&D and a range of defense experts are pushing back against a skeptical <a href=\"http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs28tracy.pdf\">study of hypersonic weapons</a> by arms control advocates at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

{"title": "‘Spectrum Superiority’ Key To All Domain Operations: Gen. Hyten", "publish_time": "2021-01-07 23:03:25", "author": ["Theresa Hitchens"], "content": "WASHINGTON: As the Joint Staff develops a\nJoint Warfighting Concept\nto guide America’s new way of war,\nAll Domain Operations,\nit’s becoming increasingly clear that control of the electromagnetic spectrum is key to its success, says Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. John Hyten. And that means setting spectrum requirements will be key to ADO.\n“We have to be able to effectively fight and win the electromagnetic spectrum fight right from the beginning — that is, electronic warfare in every domain,” Hyten told the Association of Old Crows (AOC). Hyten chairs the Joint Staff’s\nElectromagnetic Spectrum Operations Cross Functional Team\n, and, in addition, is the “senior designated official for EMSO, electromagnetic spectrum operations, in the Department of Defense.”\n“Information advantage,”\nas Breaking D readers know,\nis one of four subcomponents to the Joint Warfighting Concept, along with joint fires, all-domain command and control, and contested logistics. While JCS Chair Gen. Mark Milley tasked the Navy to flesh out the approach to joint fires; the Air Force,\nJoint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2)\n, and the Army, contested logistics,\nHyten back in September\nsaid the Joint Staff itself is working to conceptualize “information advantage” because no service volunteered.\nBut, Hyten explained, controlling use of the spectrum — that is ensuring US forces have access for communications and at the same time jamming enemy access — is critical to establishing that information advantage. “Under information advantage is the ability to achieve spectrum superiority in all domains,” Hyten said. “We have to be able to do that. If you can’t do that, you will fail. You will fail in your mission,” he told the AOC yesterday.\nThe current plan, Hyten said, is for the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC, which he chairs) to finalize the requirements for each of the Joint Warfighting Concept subcomponents “in late spring.” This will include setting requirements for the services to meet in building capabilities for what DoD now calls ElectroMagnetic Spectrum Operations (EMSO) within the information advantage subcomponent requirements set.\nEMSO, one expert explained, is a relatively new DoD term of art that encompasses\nspectrum management\nto ensure secure communications for US commanders and troops in the field\nand\nelectronic warfare (EW)\nagainst adversaries. In the past, the expert said, those two things were the purview of separate, stovepiped communities within the services and combatant commands, which let to problems — including blue-on-blue jamming.\n“So, as we publish this information advantage, we’re going to talk about how do we deal with data; how do we deal with software; how do we deal with spectrum — all those kind of pieces,” Hyten elaborated. “We’re going to define the broad-based standards and structures that all the services have to fit in, so that when they build their capabilities — their unique service capabilities — and they come together in the joint fight, they’ll be able to effectively fight and win together.”\nMeanwhile, the EMSO cross-functional team is working to figure out an implementation plan for DoD’s new\nElectromagnetic Spectrum Superiority Strategy\npublished on\nOct 29, with a deadline at the end of March.\nIn addition, Congress in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (Section 152a) gave DoD two years to transfer responsibility for governance of EMSO from Strategic Command to Hyten’s office. The mandate was spurred by the fact that Congress has for years been concerned that DoD has not exercised enough oversight of service spectrum operations, explained one congressional insider.\nIn the near term, Hyten explained, the focus will be on building STRATCOM’s capacities. “We’re going to fix STRATCOM at the beginning, and then we’ll adjust with recommendations, fully involving Congress all the way through, because they’ve rightly said, ‘you have a problem, and we’re going to be part of the solution’.”\n“The first thing that we have to do is make STRATCOM whole … because they’re under-resourced, undermanned and not fully capable of performing the duties they’ve been given by the department,” he stressed. Congress, he added, is supportive of this approach.\n(Hyten didn’t elaborate on whether Congress has agreed to more staffing or whether the budget will be increased, for STRATCOM EMSO efforts — something that would almost certainly require legislation.)\nThat said, Hyten said STRATCOM isn’t the only — and in some ways not necessarily the most critical — player in implementing the EMSO strategy. The services, he explained, also have crucial roles: developing capabilities and a testing infrastructure to go along with building new ones.\n“It’s key that we make sure that we don’t forget number one, and that is to build out the capabilities that we have to have. Number two is to organize train and equip effectively. And those jobs are the jobs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Space Force,” he stressed. “The services of the Department of Defense have to build that stuff. And if we don’t remember that, we will fail in the execution of that strategy.”\nThe “good news,” he added, is that the services are making progress on the capabilities front. The Air Force’s\nnew 350th Spectrum Warfare Wing\n— announced\nby Air Combat Command back in November\n— is set to begin operations in March. In addition, he said, “the Space Force stood up its own Delta — the Space Force equivalent of a wing — to focus on space electronic warfare [\nDelta 3\n]. The Army kicked off the first phase of its program to deliver to their brigades integrated signals intelligence EW and cyber, known as the\nTerrestrial Layer System.\nThe Navy is having success in developing and flight testing the new\nNext Generation Jammer\npod.”\nStill, Hyten summed up, “we have a lot of work to do before we get there.”\nAs I reported early last month,\nDoD Director of Electronic Warfare David Tremper says implementing the EMSO strategy will require overhauling how electronic warfare systems are developed and bought — with an eye to ensuring that EW systems are compatible with radios, radars and other spectrum-reliant devices being used on the battlefield. “Historically, we have not taken a holistic approach to how we manage spectrum-using systems tactically,” he explained to the Mitchell Institute in a Dec. 9 webinar.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: As the Joint Staff develops a <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/joint-warfighting-concept/\">Joint Warfighting Concept</a> to guide America’s new way of war, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/all-domain-operations/\">All Domain Operations,</a> it’s becoming increasingly clear that control of the electromagnetic spectrum is key to its success, says Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen.

Hyten chairs the Joint Staff’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/12/wholl-fix-ew-task-force-gropes-for-answers/\">Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Cross Functional Team</a>, and, in addition, is the “senior designated official for EMSO, electromagnetic spectrum operations, in the Department of Defense.”</p>\n<p>“Information advantage,” <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/07/milley-assigns-service-roles-in-all-domain-ops-concept/\">as Breaking D readers know,</a> is one of four subcomponents to the Joint Warfighting Concept, along with joint fires, all-domain command and control, and contested logistics. While JCS Chair Gen. Mark Milley tasked the Navy to flesh out the approach to joint fires; the Air Force, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/joint-all-domain-command-and-control-jadc2/\">Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2)</a>, and the Army, contested logistics, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/09/jroc-struggles-to-build-information-advantage-requirement/\">Hyten back in September</a> said the Joint Staff itself is working to conceptualize “information advantage” because no service volunteered.</p>\n\n<p>But, Hyten explained, controlling use of the spectrum — that is ensuring US forces have access for communications and at the same time jamming enemy access — is critical to establishing that information advantage. “Under information advantage is the ability to achieve spectrum superiority in all domains,” Hyten said. “We have to be able to do that. If you can’t do that, you will fail. You will fail in your mission,” he told the AOC yesterday.</p>\n<p>The current plan, Hyten said, is for the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC, which he chairs) to finalize the requirements for each of the Joint Warfighting Concept subcomponents “in late spring.” This will include setting requirements for the services to meet in building capabilities for what DoD now calls ElectroMagnetic Spectrum Operations (EMSO) within the information advantage subcomponent requirements set.<b> </b></p>\n\n<p>EMSO, one expert explained, is a relatively new DoD term of art that encompasses <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/spectrum-management/\">spectrum management</a> to ensure secure communications for US commanders and troops in the field <em>and</em> <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/electronic-warfare/\">electronic warfare (EW)</a> against adversaries. In the past, the expert said, those two things were the purview of separate, stovepiped communities within the services and combatant commands, which let to problems — including blue-on-blue jamming.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-104735 alignleft\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/DRS-electromagnetic-spectrum-300x181.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"181\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/DRS-electromagnetic-spectrum-300x181.jpg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/DRS-electromagnetic-spectrum.jpg 600w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/DRS-electromagnetic-spectrum-495x300.jpg 495w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/DRS-electromagnetic-spectrum-210x127.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"/> “So, as we publish this information advantage, we’re going to talk about how do we deal with data; how do we deal with software; how do we deal with spectrum — all those kind of pieces,” Hyten elaborated. “We’re going to define the broad-based standards and structures that all the services have to fit in, so that when they build their capabilities — their unique service capabilities — and they come together in the joint fight, they’ll be able to effectively fight and win together.”</p>\n\n \n<p>Meanwhile, the EMSO cross-functional team is working to figure out an implementation plan for DoD’s new <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2020/Oct/29/2002525927/-1/-1/0/ELECTROMAGNETIC_SPECTRUM_SUPERIORITY_STRATEGY.PDF\">Electromagnetic Spectrum Superiority Strategy</a> published on <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/10/pentagon-unveils-spectrum-strategy-five-eyes-talking/\">Oct 29, with a deadline at the end of March.</a></p>\n<p>In addition, Congress in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (Section 152a) gave DoD two years to transfer responsibility for governance of EMSO from Strategic Command to Hyten’s office. The mandate was spurred by the fact that Congress has for years been concerned that DoD has not exercised enough oversight of service spectrum operations, explained one congressional insider.</p>\n<p>In the near term, Hyten explained, the focus will be on building STRATCOM’s capacities. “We’re going to fix STRATCOM at the beginning, and then we’ll adjust with recommendations, fully involving Congress all the way through, because they’ve rightly said, ‘you have a problem, and we’re going to be part of the solution’.”</p>\n<p>“The first thing that we have to do is make STRATCOM whole …  because they’re under-resourced, undermanned and not fully capable of performing the duties they’ve been given by the department,” he stressed. Congress, he added, is supportive of this approach.</p>\n<p>(Hyten didn’t elaborate on whether Congress has agreed to more staffing or whether the budget will be increased, for STRATCOM EMSO efforts — something that would almost certainly require legislation.)</p>\n<p>That said, Hyten said STRATCOM isn’t the only — and in some ways not necessarily the most critical — player in implementing the EMSO strategy. The services, he explained, also have crucial roles: developing capabilities and a testing infrastructure to go along with building new ones.</p>\n<p>“It’s key that we make sure that we don’t forget number one, and that is to build out the capabilities that we have to have. Number two is to organize train and equip effectively. And those jobs are the jobs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Space Force,” he stressed. “The services of the Department of Defense have to build that stuff. And if we don’t remember that, we will fail in the execution of that strategy.”</p>\n<p>The “good news,” he added, is that the services are making progress on the capabilities front. The Air Force’s <a href=\"https://www.executivegov.com/2020/12/col-william-young-air-forces-spectrum-warfare-unit-to-focus-on-software-defined-tech/\">new 350th Spectrum Warfare Wing</a> — announced <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/11/vcsaf-wilson-presses-services-long-range-strike-role/\">by Air Combat Command back in November</a> — is set to begin operations in March. In addition, he said, “the Space Force stood up its own Delta — the Space Force equivalent of a wing — to focus on space electronic warfare [<a href=\"https://www.spaceforce.mil/News/Article/2287005/space-force-begins-transition-into-field-organizational-structure/\">Delta 3</a>]. The Army kicked off the first phase of its program to deliver to their brigades integrated signals intelligence EW and cyber, known as the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/terrestrial-layer-system/\">Terrestrial Layer System.</a> The Navy is having success in developing and flight testing the new <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/next-generation-jammer/\">Next Generation Jammer</a> pod.”</p>\n<p>Still, Hyten summed up, “we have a lot of work to do before we get there.”</p>\n<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/12/dod-needs-tighter-reins-on-ew-acquisition/\">As I reported early last month,</a> DoD Director of Electronic Warfare David Tremper says implementing the EMSO strategy will require overhauling how electronic warfare systems are developed and bought — with an eye to ensuring that EW systems are compatible with radios, radars and other spectrum-reliant devices being used on the battlefield. “Historically, we have not taken a holistic approach to how we manage spectrum-using systems tactically,” he explained to the Mitchell Institute in a Dec. 9 webinar.\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["2021 NDAA", "350th Spectrum Wing", "Air Combat Command", "air force", "All Domain Operations", "army", "Association of Old Crows", "combined joint all domain command and control (CJADC2)", "electromagnetic spectrum", "Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Cross Functional Team", "Electromagnetic Spectrum Superiority Strategy 2020", "Gen.

{"title": "AI In The Grey Zone: Afghan Lessons For Great Power Conflict", "publish_time": "2020-12-07 22:05:06", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: The regular military is increasingly adopting artificial intelligence techniques pioneered by\nspecial operators\n, with a pilot AI project underway at the celebrated 18\nth\nAirborne Corps.\nThe same\nAlgorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team\nthat developed\nProject Maven\nto track terrorists is now applying their technology to great-power conflict with\nadvanced nation-states\n, said\nRichard Schultz\n, a professor at Tuft University’s Fletcher School who co-wrote\na recent article\non AI with SOCOM’s four-star commander,\nGen. Richard Clarke\n.\n“They’re broadening out to the peer competitor fight, and they have some very interesting initiatives with the\n82nd Airborne Division\n, and the 18th Airborne [Corps],” Schultz said on a\nHudson Institute webcast\nthis afternoon. “The division wants to be the first AI-enabled division in the Army, and the corps, the first [AI-enabled] corps.”\nSOCOM was forced to adopt AI – and before that, databases and analytics – to handle the sheer volume of information it was collecting, from drone surveillance video to the outgoing call logs of captured cellphones to the biometric data so crucial to the surge in Iraq.\nAnalysts need to go through all those different kinds of data and combine them to identify terrorist ringleaders and send teams after them. It’s a feedback loop, a virtuous cycle, because each successful capture produces a new flood of data – phones, laptops, papers, bomb parts, interrogation transcripts – for the analysts to comb through to find more targets.\n“To solve this problem of all of the information coming off the battlefield, [we had] to be able to increase our targeting cycle and to be able to do it more efficiently, without hundreds of people looking at all of the information,” Gen. Clarke said on the Hudson webcast. “You could apply this same targeting [approach] using artificial intelligence to help speed up the targeting process” across the entire military. In fact, that\nAI-accelerated cycle of gathering intelligence and acting on it\nis at the heart of\nthe military’s vision for future All-Domain Operations\n.\nAI isn’t just ingesting video feeds and target location, Clarke emphasizes, but all kinds of communications as well. Even the enemy’s propaganda is a clue to what they’re really up to and who they’re working with. “You want to be able to detect how [and] what an enemy is sending and receiving, what are false narratives, what are being sent across as bots,” he said. “Those allow decision makers to make faster decisions.”\nYou see, when veteran operators like Clarke talk about “targeting,”\nthey don’t just mean blowing stuff up with drones\n– though there’s plenty of that too. The best way to engage a target was to capture them, not kill them, and with as little collateral destruction as possible. That way you had living prisoners to interrogate, intact hard drives to comb through, and unharmed local civilians willing to work with you as informers rather coming after you for revenge.\nIn many cases, Clarke said, it was as important to engage the neutrals, sending out well-crafted messages instead of smart bombs, so you could sway the population to support you and not the enemy. “In Afghanistan... from 2001 to 2018, our commanders on the ground, focused 70 percent of their time on the kinetic fight, of actually putting up putting a bomb on a target,” Clarke said. But the general recounted how a special ops commander now in Afghanistan told him that “I now spend over 70 percent of my time…delivering non-kinetic effects, because if we don’t come out with our messages, and we don’t influence the space, we will lose.”\nSmall Wars, Big Wars, Hybrid Wars\nAs the US pivots painfully from hunting guerrillas and terrorists in the Islamic world to deterring high-tech militaries like Russia and China, there’s\ngrowing disdain\nfor the hard-won skills of counterinsurgency. How could lessons learned against Taliban thugs and ISIS butchers — men with AK-47s and homemade bombs and executioners’ swords for beheadings — be relevant to a 21\nst\ncentury conflict of long-range smart weapons?\nWell,, it’s surprisingly relevant\n.\nFirst of all, the Russians and the Chinese are not fools. They have no desire to make themselves targets for the precision-guided might of the US military, even as they\nbuild up their own arsenals, networks and sensors for long-range strike\n. Instead, remembering what the Communists taught them, Moscow and Beijing use\nsubversion, propaganda, and proxies\nto achieve their goals “\nbelow the threshold of armed conflict\n,” without triggering an armed US response.\nSure, Russia’s Spetsnaz commandos are less brutal than the Taliban, and China’s “50-cent army” of social media trolls is more sophisticated than the Islamic State’s tweets of beheading videos. But the principles are much the same, which mean the countermeasures could be, too.\nSecond, even if the threshold is crossed to a full-scale shooting war, the rival armies won’t be lining up in empty fields to shoot it out. Instead, they’ll have to maneuver amidst the massive growth of global population, through megacities and urban sprawl, and in the face of ubiquitous surveillance technology, with civilians using everything from smart phones to hundred-dollar drones to share once-secret military movements. Guerrillas have long had to swim through Mao’s “sea of the people,” but increasingly the regular military does too, and you can detect it by its digital wake.\nThe traditional separations in US doctrine – between psychological operations, cyber warfare, and the real man’s business of blowing stuff up – no longer reflect reality, if they ever did.\n“There isn’t really a separate ‘information operations’ world where it’s, you know, propaganda and disinformation and social media, and then you’ve got [distinctly] military data that’s targeting data on specific military systems,” said Bryan Clark, a Hudson Institute scholar. (He’s got no “e” in his name and is no relation to the general). “They’re all merged together in the information sources that are being employed by these algorithms, because [all] they allow you to better characterize a particular target.”\nEven purely kinetic operations like airstrikes require extensive intelligence preparation, which includes requires figuring out what’s a real enemy target and what’s a civilian or neutral. You can’t just blast them all: Even if you didn’t have ethical limits, you’d run out of smart bombs before you ran out of potential targets.\n“If you’re looking at peer competitors like this, let’s say the\nSouth China Sea\n, there’s a lot of [Chinese] maritime militia ships out there that could look like fishing ships,” Clark said on the Hudson webcast. “There’s [Chinese] Coast Guard, there’s actual [PLA] Navy ships, and there’re civilian ships that it’s unclear what their purpose is. And so you have to watch the pattern of life and get an understanding of what is their job on any particular day.”\nThis kind of AI-enabled intelligence just only helps tee up targets for wartime: It could help defuse a crisis and prevent a war as well. “What if you are\nnot\nin World War III, but you have a gray zone altercation occurring?” Clark asked. “What’s the best way to defuse that with the lowest level of escalation possible?”\nMuch like SOCOM tracking terrorist ringleaders in Afghanistan, you’d want to sort through the Twitter bots, the online agitators, and the proxies to figure out who’s stirring up the trouble. Then you can try to shut them down – not with a missile, but maybe with\na cyber attack to disable their social media\n, electronic warfare to jam their transmissions, or even a well-timed public statement to reveal a state-sponsored troll’s true identity to the world.\nConsider a Chinese “fishing boat” that violates Vietnamese waters to create an international incident. Its transmissions, its point of origin and the personal contacts of its crew are all relevant data for the US commander trying to defuse the crisis, and AI can help pull all that together before it’s too late.\n“Those are all pieces of information that a commander can use to decide, ‘what’s the best effect I can use to cause that guy to stop doing whatever he’s doing?’” Clark said, “and do it in a way that’s proportional, as opposed to hitting them with, you know, a cruise missile.”\n“We are seeing that AI-enabled algorithms can ingest data from many different sources,” Clark told me in a follow-up email. “As long as the data is formatted in ways that it can understand” –\nwhich can be a big “if” indeed\n– “the AI’s inference engine will identify relationships and draw implications.”\n“The automated integration of multiple open, unclassified sources could guide US operations on a scale and speed far beyond today’s capabilities,” Clark wrote. “It also leverages the rapidly growing amount of data available from commercial surveillance and consumer social and public media, which is vastly greater than the data available from government sources. Increasingly, these unclassified sources can support the bulk of intelligence needs, with government sources providing the niche capabilities.”\nWhile the regular military is taking on this AI technology, Special Operations Command remains determined to play a leading role. “SOCOM can be a pathfinder for the Department of Defense,” Gen. Clarke said on the Hudson webcast. “\nSOCOM’s going to keep pushing\n.”\n“We don’t have a choice,” he said. “If we don’t,\nwe’ll get behind our adversaries\n.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The regular military is increasingly adopting artificial intelligence techniques pioneered by <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/11/what-acting-secdef-millers-special-ops-shift-means/\">special operators</a>, with a pilot AI project underway at the celebrated 18<sup>th</sup> Airborne Corps.</p>\n<p>The same <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/algorithmic-warfare-cross-functional-team/\">Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team</a> that developed <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/08/air-combat-commander-doesnt-trust-project-mavens-artificial-intelligence-yet/\">Project Maven</a> to track terrorists is now applying their technology to great-power conflict with <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/12/dod-official-warns-china-pulling-ahead-in-data-simulation-efforts/\">advanced nation-states</a>, said <a href=\"https://fletcher.tufts.edu/people/richard-shultz\">Richard Schultz</a>, a professor at Tuft University’s Fletcher School who co-wrote <a href=\"https://mwi.usma.edu/big-data-at-war-special-operations-forces-project-maven-and-twenty-first-century-warfare/\">a recent article</a> on AI with SOCOM’s four-star commander, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/06/socoms-hyper-enabled-operator-will-it-work-this-time/\">Gen. Richard Clarke</a>.</p>\n<p>“They’re broadening out to the peer competitor fight, and they have some very interesting initiatives with the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/11/new-army-network-a-revolution-for-airborne-commander/\">82nd Airborne Division</a>, and the 18th Airborne [Corps],” Schultz said on a <a href=\"https://www.hudson.org/events/1889-video-event-the-role-of-ai-and-big-data-in-military-operations-a-discussion-with-general-richard-d-clarke-and-dr-richard-shultz122020\">Hudson Institute webcast</a> this afternoon. “The division wants to be the first AI-enabled division in the Army, and the corps, the first [AI-enabled] corps.”</p>\n<p>SOCOM was forced to adopt AI – and before that, databases and analytics – to handle the sheer volume of information it was collecting, from drone surveillance video to the outgoing call logs of captured cellphones to the biometric data so crucial to the surge in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Analysts need to go through all those different kinds of data and combine them to identify terrorist ringleaders and send teams after them. It’s a feedback loop, a virtuous cycle, because each successful capture produces a new flood of data – phones, laptops, papers, bomb parts, interrogation transcripts – for the analysts to comb through to find more targets.</p>\n\n<p>“To solve this problem of all of the information coming off the battlefield, [we had] to be able to increase our targeting cycle and to be able to do it more efficiently, without hundreds of people looking at all of the information,” Gen. Clarke said on the Hudson webcast. “You could apply this same targeting [approach] using artificial intelligence to help speed up the targeting process” across the entire military. In fact, that <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/11/jaic-chief-asks-can-ai-prevent-another-1914/\">AI-accelerated cycle of gathering intelligence and acting on it</a> is at the heart of <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/10/services-fear-of-losing-control-blocking-jadc2-progress-say-experts/\">the military’s vision for future All-Domain Operations</a>.</p>\n<p>AI isn’t just ingesting video feeds and target location, Clarke emphasizes, but all kinds of communications as well. Even the enemy’s propaganda is a clue to what they’re really up to and who they’re working with. “You want to be able to detect how [and] what an enemy is sending and receiving, what are false narratives, what are being sent across as bots,” he said. “Those allow decision makers to make faster decisions.”</p>\n\n \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-44538 size-medium\" src=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/MavenII-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/MavenII-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/MavenII-768x511.jpg 768w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/MavenII-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/MavenII-210x140.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"/>You see, when veteran operators like Clarke talk about “targeting,”<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/11/military-ai-is-bigger-than-the-kill-chain-jaic-chief/\"> they don’t just mean blowing stuff up with drones</a> – though there’s plenty of that too. The best way to engage a target was to capture them, not kill them, and with as little collateral destruction as possible. That way you had living prisoners to interrogate, intact hard drives to comb through, and unharmed local civilians willing to work with you as informers rather  coming after you for revenge.</p>\n<p>In many cases, Clarke said, it was as important to engage the neutrals, sending out well-crafted messages instead of smart bombs, so you could sway the population to support you and not the enemy. “In Afghanistan... from 2001 to 2018, our commanders on the ground, focused 70 percent of their time on the kinetic fight, of actually putting up putting a bomb on a target,” Clarke said. But the general recounted how a special ops commander now in Afghanistan told him that “I now spend over 70 percent of my time…delivering non-kinetic effects, because if we don’t come out with our messages, and we don’t influence the space, we will lose.”</p>\n<p>Small Wars, Big Wars, Hybrid Wars</p>\n<p>As the US pivots painfully from hunting guerrillas and terrorists in the Islamic world to deterring high-tech militaries like Russia and China, there’s <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/12/csis-bad-idea-assuming-the-small-wars-era-is-over/\">growing disdain</a> for the hard-won skills of counterinsurgency. How could lessons learned against Taliban thugs and ISIS butchers — men with AK-47s and homemade bombs and executioners’ swords for beheadings — be relevant to a 21<sup>st</sup> century conflict of long-range smart weapons?</p>\n<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/06/counterterror-mission-blends-into-competition-with-china-russia-how-socom-copes/\">Well,, it’s surprisingly relevant</a>.\n<p>First of all, the Russians and the Chinese are not fools. They have no desire to make themselves targets for the precision-guided might of the US military, even as they <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/11/chinese-party-sets-bold-military-goal-mechanized-informationized-by-2027/\">build up their own arsenals, networks and sensors for long-range strike</a>. Instead, remembering what the Communists taught them, Moscow and Beijing use <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/08/desperate-need-for-speed-as-army-takes-on-chinese-russians-isis-trolls/\">subversion, propaganda, and proxies</a> to achieve their goals “<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2018/06/russia-china-are-outmaneuvering-us-generals-recommend-new-authorities-doctrine/\">below the threshold of armed conflict</a>,” without triggering an armed US response.</p>\n<p>Sure, Russia’s Spetsnaz commandos are less brutal than the Taliban, and China’s “50-cent army” of social media trolls is more sophisticated than the Islamic State’s tweets of beheading videos. But the principles are much the same, which mean the countermeasures could be, too.</p>\n<p>Second, even if the threshold is crossed to a full-scale shooting war, the rival armies won’t be lining up in empty fields to shoot it out. Instead, they’ll have to maneuver amidst the massive growth of global population, through megacities and urban sprawl, and in the face of ubiquitous surveillance technology, with civilians using everything from smart phones to hundred-dollar drones to share once-secret military movements. Guerrillas have long had to swim through Mao’s “sea of the people,” but increasingly the regular military does too, and you can detect it by its digital wake.</p>\n<p>The traditional separations in US doctrine – between psychological operations, cyber warfare, and the real man’s business of blowing stuff up – no longer reflect reality, if they ever did.</p>\n<p>“There isn’t really a separate ‘information operations’ world where it’s, you know, propaganda and disinformation and social media, and then you’ve got [distinctly] military data that’s targeting data on specific military systems,” said Bryan Clark, a Hudson Institute scholar. (He’s got no “e” in his name and is no relation to the general). “They’re all merged together in the information sources that are being employed by these algorithms, because [all] they allow you to better characterize a particular target.”</p>\n<p>Even purely kinetic operations like airstrikes require extensive intelligence preparation, which includes requires figuring out what’s a real enemy target and what’s a civilian or neutral. You can’t just blast them all: Even if you didn’t have ethical limits, you’d run out of smart bombs before you ran out of potential targets.</p>\n<p>“If you’re looking at peer competitors like this, let’s say the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/south-china-sea/\">South China Sea</a>, there’s a lot of [Chinese] maritime militia ships out there that could look like fishing ships,” Clark said on the Hudson webcast. “There’s [Chinese] Coast Guard, there’s actual [PLA] Navy ships, and there’re civilian ships that it’s unclear what their purpose is. And so you have to watch the pattern of life and get an understanding of what is their job on any particular day.”</p>\n<p>This kind of AI-enabled intelligence just only helps tee up targets for wartime: It could help defuse a crisis and prevent a war as well. “What if you are <em>not</em> in World War III, but you have a gray zone altercation occurring?” Clark asked. “What’s the best way to defuse that with the lowest level of escalation possible?”</p>\n<p>Much like SOCOM tracking terrorist ringleaders in Afghanistan, you’d want to sort through the Twitter bots, the online agitators, and the proxies to figure out who’s stirring up the trouble. Then you can try to shut them down – not with a missile, but maybe with <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/04/cyber-warfare-in-the-grey-zone-wake-up-washington/\">a cyber attack to disable their social media</a>, electronic warfare to jam their transmissions, or even a well-timed public statement to reveal a state-sponsored troll’s true identity to the world.</p>\n<p>Consider a Chinese “fishing boat” that violates Vietnamese waters to create an international incident.

{"title": "Artificial Intelligence, Lawyers And Laws Of War", "publish_time": "2021-04-23 15:01:10", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: “My entire career, I’ve stood around a mapboard and the lawyer’s always right there,” said\nGen. Mike Murray\n, who commanded troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. But in a highly automated future war of\nlong-range missiles\n,\nswarming robots\n, and\nsensor jamming\n, warned the head of\nArmy Futures Command\n, “you’re not going to have 30 seconds to stand around a mapboard and make those decisions.”\n“Back when I was a brigade commander, even when I was commander of the Third Infantry Division in Afghanistan,” Murray recalled, “life and death decisions were being made just about every day, and it usually was around, either [a] mapboard or some sort of digital display.” Along with the staff officers for intelligence, operations and fire support, he said, one of a handful of “key people standing around that mapboard” was the command’s lawyer, its Staff Judge Advocate.\n“The lawyer always got a say,” the general went on. “Is this is just a viable course of action, given the law of armed conflict?… Is this a legal response? And usually those discussions would take some time. I think in the future the opportunities to get people around the map board and have a detailed discussion — to include discussions about the legality of the actions you’re contemplating as a commander — will be few and far between.”\nHow will the Army solve this problem? Gen. Murray raised this question addressing\na West Point-Army Futures Command conference\non the law of future war, but he didn’t provide an answer. The speakers who followed didn’t seem to have an answer, either.\nThat’s a growing problem for the Army, which prides itself on meticulous adherence to federal law, Pentagon regulation, and professional military ethics, even in the most extreme conditions. And it’s particular tricky when artificial intelligence is involved, because AI often operates on timescales much faster than an individual human brain can follow, let alone the speed at which a formal staff process moves.\nIn its\nProject Convergence\nwargames last fall, Murray noted, the Army already used AI to detect potential targets in satellite images, then\nmove that targeting data\nto artillery batteries on the ground in\n“tens of seconds,”\nas opposed to the “tens of minutes” the traditional call-for-fires process takes. But there was always a human in the loop, he emphasized, approving the computer-generated order before it could be transmitted to the guns.\nThat may not be possible with every type of target, however. Imagine, Murray said, a swarm of a hundred or more drones is inbound, flying low and jamming US sensors so it can evade detection until the last moment. “It within a human’s ability to pick out which ones need to be engaged first and then make 100 individual engagement decisions?” he asked. “Is it even necessary to have a human in loop, if you’re talking about effects against [i.e. attacking] an unmanned platform?”\nFor fast-moving, unmanned targets like drones or missiles, it may be necessary to take the human out of the loop and let the automation open fire against targets that meet pre-set criteria – “and in many ways we do this already,” Murray said. That’s true for the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, & Mortar (C-RAM) system used to protect many Forward Operating Bases, itself derived from the Navy’s Phalanx anti-missile gun. Automated fire is even an available mode on Patriot missiles, he said. (In fact,\nPatriot batteries on automated mode mistakenly killed three US and British pilots\nin 2003).\n“Where I draw the line — and this is, I think well within our current policies – [is], if you’re talking about a lethal effect against another human, you have to have a human in that decision-making process,” Murray said. That’s the model used at Project Convergence last fall. And it’s official Defense Department policy.\nMachines and humans working together will be slower than autonomous machines, but they will be faster than unaided humans, and potentially more accurate than either.\nIn the Cold War, Murray recalled, tank gunners trained on flash cards of NATO and Warsaw Pact equipment. When a young soldier identified friend or foe correctly 80 percent of the time, they were deemed battle-ready. After decades of AI advances, “we have algorithms today on\nplatforms we’re experimenting with\nthat can get to about 98.8 percent accuracy,” he said, “so actually artificial intelligence has the ability to make us more safe and make better decisions.”\nBut, “that algorithm just makes a recommendation,” Murray emphasized. “\nThe trigger pull is up to that kid behind the cannon\n.”\nThe hard part, though, is\ngetting soldiers to trust the AI enough to use it\nin combat– but not enough to mindlessly click “okay” to the computer’s every recommendation,\na potentially deadly phenomenon\nknown as automation bias.", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: “My entire career, I’ve stood around a mapboard and the lawyer’s always right there,” said <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/qa-gen-mike-murray-on-jadc2-project-convergence-future-war-exclusive/\">Gen.

And it’s particular tricky when artificial intelligence is involved, because AI often operates on timescales much faster than an individual human brain can follow, let alone the speed at which a formal staff process moves.</p>\n\n<p>In its <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/project-convergence/\">Project Convergence</a> wargames last fall, Murray noted, the Army already used AI to detect potential targets in satellite images, then <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/09/pushing-data-from-space-to-mud-project-convergence/\">move that targeting data</a> to artillery batteries on the ground in <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/09/target-gone-in-20-seconds-army-sensor-shooter-test/\">“tens of seconds,”</a> as opposed to the “tens of minutes” the traditional call-for-fires process takes. But there was always a human in the loop, he emphasized, approving the computer-generated order before it could be transmitted to the guns.</p>\n<p>That may not be possible with every type of target, however. Imagine, Murray said, a swarm of a hundred or more drones is inbound, flying low and jamming US sensors so it can evade detection until the last moment. “It within a human’s ability to pick out which ones need to be engaged first and then make 100 individual engagement decisions?” he asked. “Is it even necessary to have a human in loop, if you’re talking about effects against [i.e. attacking] an unmanned platform?”</p>\n\n \n<p>For fast-moving, unmanned targets like drones or missiles, it may be necessary to take the human out of the loop and let the automation open fire against targets that meet pre-set criteria – “and in many ways we do this already,” Murray said. That’s true for the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, & Mortar (C-RAM) system used to protect many Forward Operating Bases, itself derived from the Navy’s Phalanx anti-missile gun. Automated fire is even an available mode on Patriot missiles, he said. (In fact, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2017/06/artificial-stupidity-fumbling-the-handoff/\">Patriot batteries on automated mode mistakenly killed three US and British pilots</a> in 2003).</p>\n<p>“Where I draw the line — and this is, I think well within our current policies – [is], if you’re talking about a lethal effect against another human, you have to have a human in that decision-making process,” Murray said. That’s the model used at Project Convergence last fall. And it’s official Defense Department policy.</p>\n<p>Machines and humans working together will be slower than autonomous machines, but they will be faster than unaided humans, and potentially more accurate than either.</p>\n<p>In the Cold War, Murray recalled, tank gunners trained on flash cards of NATO and Warsaw Pact equipment. When a young soldier identified friend or foe correctly 80 percent of the time, they were deemed battle-ready. After decades of AI advances, “we have algorithms today on <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/10/bd-checks-out-armys-robotic-gun-atlas/\">platforms we’re experimenting with</a> that can get to about 98.8 percent accuracy,” he said, “so actually artificial intelligence has the ability to make us more safe and make better decisions.”</p>\n<p>But, “that algorithm just makes a recommendation,” Murray emphasized. “<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/03/atlas-killer-robot-no-virtual-crewman-yes/\">The trigger pull is up to that kid behind the cannon</a>.”</p>\n<p>The hard part, though, is <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2017/07/artificial-stupidity-learning-to-trust-the-machine/\">getting soldiers to trust the AI enough to use it</a> in combat– but not enough to mindlessly click “okay” to the computer’s every recommendation, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2017/06/artificial-stupidity-fumbling-the-handoff/\">a potentially deadly phenomenon</a> known as automation bias.</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["AI ethics", "air and missile defense", "Army Futures Command", "artificial intelligence", "Automated Target Recognition", "command and control", "Gen.

A spokesperson for the ANG was unable to provide more specifics, including the price tag, noting that more information will be released when the exercise is completed.\nThe upgrades are based on three separate pods, all of which have been being assessed by the ANG under its\nGhost Reaper\nconcept, the release said. Prime MQ-9 contractor General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI), in fact, has been working on integration of the pods over the last year. The three are:\nNorthrop Grumman’s Freedom Pod,\nwhich houses the company’s Freedom Radio gateway system that can connect fourth- and fifth-generation fighters.\nRosetta Echo Advanced Payloads (REAP) pod\nmade by Ultra Electronics Inc. that connects to ground systems via Link 16; and,\nGA-ASI’s own Centerline Avionics Bay (CAB)\nthat will allow software to be continuously improved, including via the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nThe ANG demo comes as the active Air Force also is moving ahead with MQ-9 upgrades to extend aircraft life and boost utility in a high-end fight with peer competitors.\nAir Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC)\nannounced April 21\nthat it is working with GA-ASI on “several fleet enhancement capabilities” to increase the drone’s “effectiveness against near-peer adversary threats” packaged in a new configuration called “MQ-9 Multi-Domain Operation (M2DO) aircraft.” Under the contract, worth $272.3 million, GA-ASI will deliver 19 of the M2DO aircraft,\naccording to colleague John Tirpak.\nThe service also is “retrofitting a portion of the already fielded MQ-9 fleet to the same M2DO configuration, allowing the Air Force to leverage current fleet numbers to meet future warfighter requirements through the service life of the aircraft,” the release added.\nWithout providing many specifics, AFLCMC said the improvements will include “retrofits that will mitigate potential jamming,” changes to “increase the electric power” to enable future updates desired by Combatant Commanders, and “upgrades to the electro-optical/infra-red sensor and will expand the types of weapons the platform will be able to carry.”\nThe two efforts are seemingly unrelated, although that is not\nquite\nclear given that Air Force/National Guard public affairs officers were unable to answer requests for clarification today.\nWhat is clear is that the Air Force is trying to figure out how to maintain and bolster the Reaper’s future usefulness, even as the service\ncontinues to push divesting itself\nof some of the fleet — as Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown telegraphed back in February. ““I will tell you right now, the MQ-9 is still a\nvery popular platform with the Combatant Commanders,\n” Brown told reporters. “So, it’s not something we can just walk away from.”\n“Over the past year, our engineers have been working hard to demonstrate a variety of advanced capabilities for the MQ-9,” GA-ASI spokesperson C. Mark Brinkley said today. “What we’re seeing now is a lot of different efforts coming together, with a variety of demonstrations and somewhat unrelated efforts, but all of them unified around exploring the future of the aircraft and the massive opportunities that the MQ-9 brings. Some of these efforts are independent of the others, and they really run across all the services.”\nHe was reluctant (quite understandably) to provide specifics on the two efforts, however. “For specific details on each effort, we have to send you to those folks for details.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: Upgrades to the MQ-9 Reaper’s comms and targeting capabilities are being demo’d by the Air National Guard (ANG) during the<a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/f-15ex-to-fly-in-indo-pacoms-northern-edge/\"> Northern Edge 2021 exercise</a> in the Arctic, with a goal to help the venerable drone “play an increased, more prominent role in the command and control arena of the battlefield.”</p>\n<p>The new pod-based capabilities will be flown onboard a 174TH ATKW MQ-9, <a href=\"https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2597355/mq-9-reaper-gets-enhanced-capabilities/\">according to a May 6 press release</a> from the New York Air National Guard’s 174th Attack Wing.</p>\n<p>The MQ-9 will demo “auto-take-off and landing and high-end fight capabilities” during the May 3-14 exercise, led each year by Indo-Pacific Command, a <a href=\"https://www.acc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2590342/53rd-wing-gears-up-for-northern-edge-21/\">separate April 29 release</a> by the Air Force’s 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron, 53rd Wing.</p>\n\n<p>The ANG upgrades being showcased during Northern Edge are being funded by The National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account, and are specifically aimed at the legacy drones flown by the Guard, the ANG release said.

The three are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/02/network-architecture-for-the-great-power-competition/\">Northrop Grumman’s Freedom Pod,</a> which houses the company’s Freedom Radio gateway system that can connect fourth- and fifth-generation fighters.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ultra.group/us/our-business-units/intelligence-communications/command-control-intelligence-c2i/airborne-pods/\">Rosetta Echo Advanced Payloads (REAP) pod</a> made by Ultra Electronics Inc. that connects to ground systems via Link 16; and,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ga.com/ga-asi-new-centerline-avionics-bay-increases-mq-9a-capability\">GA-ASI’s own Centerline Avionics Bay (CAB)</a> that will allow software to be continuously improved, including via the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The ANG demo comes as the active Air Force also is moving ahead with MQ-9 upgrades to extend aircraft life and boost utility in a high-end fight with peer competitors.</p>\n<p>Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC)<a href=\"https://www.aflcmc.af.mil/news/article-display/article/2579674/reaper-mods-targeted-to-provide-capability-for-near-peer-threats/\"> announced April 21</a> that it is working with GA-ASI on “several fleet enhancement capabilities” to increase the drone’s “effectiveness against near-peer adversary threats” packaged in a new configuration called “MQ-9 Multi-Domain Operation (M2DO) aircraft.” Under the contract, worth $272.3 million, GA-ASI will deliver 19 of the M2DO aircraft, <a href=\"https://www.airforcemag.com/air-force-to-upgrade-mq-9s-mission-and-capabilities-for-near-peer-fight/\">according to colleague John Tirpak.</a></p>\n\n \n<p>The service also is “retrofitting a portion of the already fielded MQ-9 fleet to the same M2DO configuration, allowing the Air Force to leverage current fleet numbers to meet future warfighter requirements through the service life of the aircraft,” the release added.</p>\n<p>Without providing many specifics, AFLCMC said the improvements will include “retrofits that will mitigate potential jamming,” changes to “increase the electric power” to enable future updates desired by Combatant Commanders, and “upgrades to the electro-optical/infra-red sensor and will expand the types of weapons the platform will be able to carry.”</p>\n<p>The two efforts are seemingly unrelated, although that is not <em>quite</em> clear given that Air Force/National Guard public affairs officers were unable to answer requests for clarification today.</p>\n<p>What is clear is that the Air Force is trying to figure out how to maintain and bolster the Reaper’s future usefulness, even as the service <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/02/new-air-force-isr-strategy-ready-including-mq-9/\">continues to push divesting itself</a> of some of the fleet — as Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown telegraphed back in February. ““I will tell you right now, the MQ-9 is still a <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/07/combatant-commanders-want-reaper-to-stay/\">very popular platform with the Combatant Commanders,</a>” Brown told reporters. “So,  it’s not something we can just walk away from.”</p>\n<p>“Over the past year, our engineers have been working hard to demonstrate a variety of advanced capabilities for the MQ-9,” GA-ASI spokesperson C. Mark Brinkley said today. “What we’re seeing now is a lot of different efforts coming together, with a variety of demonstrations and somewhat unrelated efforts, but all of them unified around exploring the future of the aircraft and the massive opportunities that the MQ-9 brings. Some of these efforts are independent of the others, and they really run across all the services.”</p>\n<p>He was reluctant (quite understandably) to provide specifics on the two efforts, however. “For specific details on each effort, we have to send you to those folks for details.”</p>\n</div> \n", "source": "", "keywords": ["air force", "Air Force Life Cycle Management Center LCMC", "Air National Guard", "arctic", "drones", "General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc.", "Indo-Pacific Command", "MQ-9", "MQ-9 Reaper", "Northrop Grumman", "UAVs", "Ultra Electronics Inc."], "categories": [], "img_data": [{"img_url": "https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Ghost-Reaper-1024x684.jpeg", "img_describe": "An MQ-9 Reaper with three Ghost Reaper pods attached awaits takeoff at Hancock Field Air National Guard Base, Syracuse, New York.", "img_name": "news/img_2021_07_21_60f798e5435cc49f1f88d7d8.png"}], "video_data": [], "url": "https://breakingdefense.com/2021/05/air-guard-shows-off-new-ghost-reaper-chops-at-northern-edge/", "site_name": "breakingdefense", "insert_time": "2021-07-21 11:47:49"}
{"title": "Faster, Tougher, Smarter: Army’s Future Armored Force EXCLUSIVE", "publish_time": "2021-04-05 11:01:28", "author": ["Sydney J. Freedberg Jr."], "content": "WASHINGTON: The tanks, they are a-changin’. the Army’s deadline to submit concepts for a new\nOptionally Manned Fighting Vehicle\nthat will replace the Reagan-era M2 Bradley is just 11 days away,\nApril 16\n. The service is already buying\na replacement\nfor the even older M113, a tracked workhorse that fought in Vietnam. And it’s experimenting with remote-controlled\nRobotic Combat Vehicles\nand even exploring unmanned options to replace the massive M1 Abrams main battle tank.\nBut how does\nall this new technology\ntranslate into better tactics and more options for commanders? To get a glimpse of that future armored force, I sat down for an exclusive interview with the\narmor modernization director\nat Army Futures Command,\nMaj. Gen. Richard Ross Coffman\n.\nThe essential takeaways:\nRobotic scouts and better sensors will spot threats earlier and let the manned force advance more boldly.\nAutomotive improvements and replacing the slowest vehicle, the Vietnam-vintage M113, will get the whole force moving faster over rough terrain.\nNew weapons and protections will let it kill the enemy from longer range and survive bigger hits in return.\nSpeed, Sensors, & Survivability\n“All of these systems are specifically designed to increase situational awareness and understanding of the commander so they can make decisions faster,” Coffman told me. “They’re going to move faster because they’re going to give information to commanders more rapidly and reduce the risk” of stumbling into an ambush during a rapid advance.\nReagan-era vehicles, let alone Vietnam-vintage ones, just don’t have the electrical wiring to support a lot of cutting-edge communications and sensors. But nowadays even civilian vehicles have cameras all around to automatically warn of danger, and modern war machines are built the same way, to detect much more serious threats than a car crash. What’s more, the military sensors are being networked, so the commander can see what every vehicle in their formation sees, dramatically expanding their view of the battlefield.\nNow add to that network some\nrelatively expendable robots\n— both land and air – that you can send to\nscout ahead of your human forces\n. That makes it possible to move much faster.\nWhat limits the pace of an armored advance isn’t the physical speed of the vehicles or even the difficulty of the terrain: It’s the risk of ambush. The more uncertain you are of the enemy’s location, the more time you spend checking potential ambush spots. For an armored force, that can be a particularly laborious process, especially if you have to stop and dismount foot troops to investigate buildings, swamps, dense woods, or other areas tracked vehicles can’t enter. Conversely, the better you know where the enemy is and – just as crucial –\nisn’t\n, the more rapidly you can advance.\n“The aerial and ground unmanned vehicles will allow us to move much faster,” Coffman told me, “[because] if you know where the enemy is located, you can move very rapidly. If you don’t know, then you must conduct reconnaissance... so you’re not just blindly walking into an enemy ambush.”\nOf course, reconnaissance, sensors, and networks are never perfect, and sometimes even the smartest soldier gets ambushed. For those occasions, you really want to have a vehicle tough enough to keep you alive when it takes a hit.\nWhat’s more, the tougher your vehicle, the more risks you can take, which – again – allows you to move faster. (In fact, the original purpose of the tank was to restore mobility to the Western Front by advancing through machinegun fire, flattening barbed wire, and crossing trenches). While the\nRobotic Combat Vehicles\nare lightly armored and relatively expendable, the new manned combat vehicles will be much more survivable than their predecessors.\nThat’s especially true against underbody blasts from roadside bombs and land mines, threats that can slow vehicle movement to a painstaking crawl. The M113 “\naluminum coffin\n” was so vulnerable to mines in Vietnam that troops routinely rode on the roof instead of inside, while the M2 Bradley and M1 Abrams were designed for a defensive war against invading Russians, a war in which the minefields would be laid by NATO, not the enemy. By contrast, modern machines like the M113 replacement, the tracked Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), and the Humvee successor, the 4×4\nJoint Light Tactical Vehicle\n(JLTV), are specifically designed to absorb and dissipate blasts from below.\nAMPV is based on the Bradley design – it looks like a Bradley with no turret – but its larger, stronger hull incorporates lessons painfully learned since 9/11.\n“AMPV is more survivable than a Bradley,” Coffman told me. “What you’re seeing is the benefit of over a decade of combat operations in the Middle East. The EFPs [Explosively Formed Penetrators] that our enemy used against us, the large- double stacked, triple stacked mines that we saw the enemy use, now we’ve accounted for those in our designs.”\nAMPV, OMFV, MBT?\nGood armor and situational awareness are the biggest contributors to battlefield mobility, but simple speed matters, especially cross-country. This is another of the advantages the new AMPV has over the venerable M113.\n“Our M113s were really the slowest vehicles that we had on the battlefield…Even on flat roads they just couldn’t keep up with the M1 tank,” Coffman said. “AMPV will be able to absolutely maintain pace with the Abrams.”\nNow, AMPV isn’t intended to advance alongside the M1 Abrams and M2 Bradley in the first wave of an assault. It’s a second-line vehicle, well-armored but lightly armed, meant to follow close behind the frontline force, replacing a wide range of M113 variants.\nThe five AMPV models\ninclude an armored ambulance, a mobile surgery, a mobile command post, a mortar carrier for close-in fire support, and a general-purpose hauler of troops and supplies.\n“By increasing the mobility, survivability, and capability of our workhorse, which is the AMPV, we’re increasing the pace that the whole team can move,” Coffman told me.\nIt’s also easier to\nkeep\nAMPV moving, since it’s far less prone to breakdowns and far easier to maintain than the geriatric M113.\n“Maintaining a 60-year-old fleet of vehicles is very expensive and the supply chain is very hard to maintain,” he said. “AMPV parts will be readily available, and it will have common parts with the PIM “and the existing Bradleys.”\n(PIM is\nPaladin Integrated Management\n, the latest upgrade to the M109 howitzer, which entered service in Vietnam but has been almost totally rebuilt. An even more advanced\nExtended Range Cannon Artillery\nversion is now in prototype).\nIf AMPV is so great, why not just make a heavily-automated, heavily-armed version with a turret and use that to replace the existing Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle? “Someone could absolutely propose that” as their Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle concept, Coffman told me. But OMFV could be something\nmuch more innovative and even strange\n.\nFor example, t\nthe Army’s desired “characteristics” for OMFV\n– they’re not yet formal “requirements” – say a platoon of vehicles should carry 30 fully equipped infantry as passengers. But\nit carefully doesn’t say how many vehicles are in a platoon\n, so you could conceivably have a single huge one carrying 30 passengers or 30 mini-machines carrying one apiece. “It could be a jet ski or a yacht,” Coffman said.\nThe one non-negotiable demand: OMFV must carry infantry through enemy fire to their assault point more safely and effectively than ever before. That includes better armor and mobility, as well as improved sensors and weapons, since the best way to ensure your own survival is to kill the enemy first.\n“The situational awareness that we’ll see will be exponentially better than what you have on a Bradley today,” Coffman said. If you combine that with longer-ranged weapons, he said, “we will be able to identify the enemy before they can identify us and destroy the enemy beyond the capabilities of our adversary.”\nNow, the OMFV is being designed to outfight comparable vehicles: the middle-weight, moderately well-armed and armored troop carriers known as Infantry Fighting Vehicles. It’s not being built to take on main battle tanks. That role remains that of the massively armored M1 Abrams main battle tank (MBT) – at least for now.\nHowever, the Army is studying a potential future vehicle or vehicles to replace the Abrams, Coffman said. There’s no official name, although “\nDecisive Lethality Platform\n” and “\nOptionally Manned Tank\n” have come up in previous reporting. Even more so than OMFV, the Army is looking at a wide range of possibilities, including unmanned and optionally manned vehicles.\n“Everything is on the table at this point,” Coffman said. “We’re exploring technologies, we’re exploring options for what comes after the\nSEP v3\n,” the latest upgrade of the\nmuch-upgraded\nAbrams.\nThere have been advancements with main battle tank technologies that we are very, very excited about,” he told me. Those include\nAI-aided target recognition\n, low-recoil cannon, automatic loaders,\nactive protection against anti-tank weapons\n, and signature management to make a tank harder to detect on infrared or by its radio-frequency emissions. “There’s just a whole bunch of things that are interesting and fun to think about,” Coffman said, “[for] how we can better wage war as we close with and destroy our future adversaries.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: The tanks, they are a-changin’. the Army’s deadline to submit concepts for a new <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/omfv/\">Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle</a> that will replace the Reagan-era M2 Bradley is just 11 days away, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2021/03/army-outlines-ambitious-schedule-for-robots-armor/\">April 16</a>.

{"title": "Indo-Pacific Commander Delivers $27 Billion Plan to Congress", "publish_time": "2021-03-02 02:50:44", "author": ["Paul McLeary"], "content": "WASHINGTON: As the Biden administration weighs how to manage China, Indo-Pacific Command has crafted a $27.3 billion plan to buy new missile defense systems, place radar and missile defense systems on the ground, launch satellites and build state-of-the-art training ranges across the region.\nThe report, delivered today to Capitol Hill, sketches out the budget for the 2022 budget and in the years out to 2027, envisioning a long-range plan that Indo-Pacom head Adm. Phil Davidson\nfirst introduced last year\n. A copy of the Executive Summary was obtained by Breaking Defense.\nThe plan for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative includes $4.6 billion in 2022, which the document points out is “two-thirds the amount spent on the European Defense Initiative in FY20 ($5.9B).”\nThe document tells lawmakers that the US “requires highly survivable, precision-strike networks along the First Island Chain, featuring increased quantities of ground-based weapons. These networks must be operationally decentralized and geographically distributed along the western Pacific archipelagos using Service agnostic infrastructure.”\nDavidson plans to formally roll out the report at\nan event hosted by\nthe American Enterprise Institure on Thursday, at a time when the Biden administration is putting together it’s 2022 budget. The final DoD topline\nis expected to come in\naround $740 billion, roughly the same as the 2021 and 2020 budgets, meaning hard choices will have to be made within the Pentagon about where to allocate resources.\nAt the top of the admiral’s acquisition priority list is a $1.6 billion Aegis Ashore missile defense system in Guam, something\nhe has long said\nis his No. 1 priority.\nNext is a $197 million “Tactical Multi-Mission Over-the-Horizon Radar” to be placed in Palau to detect and track air and surface targets.

Davidson is also looking for $206 million for “specialized manned aircraft to provide discrete, multi-source intelligence collection requirements” across the region, along with $3.3 billion for “highly survivable, precision-strike fires” that can support troops on the ground, ships at sea and aircraft from distances greater than 500km.\nDavidson previewed some of the report today at\nan AFCEA conference in Hawaii\n. “We must convince Beijing that the costs to achieve its objectives by military force are simply too high,” he said, while calling for major investments in multi-domain training ranges spread across the region where the US and allies could train together, and integrate operations.\nThe indications so far are that the Biden administration will take a tough stance with Beijing, with the military playing a major role in the strategy.\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin\ntold senators last month,\n“China is the top priority,” and pledged to publish a new National Defense Strategy in 2022, updating the 2018 version. That report, produced by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, is considered a landmark in American strategy and re-oriented Washington’s focus on a rising China.\n“There is no doubt” China poses the “most significant challenge of any nation state to the United States,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month. “We have to start by approaching China from a position of strength, not weakness.”\nThe report breaks down the priorities Joint Force Lethality; Force Design and Posture; Strengthen Allies and Partners; Exercises, Experimentation, and Innovation; and Logistics and Security Enablers.\nThe 2021 NDAA included $6.9 billion for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative over two years, with just $2.2 billion of that coming in 2021, placing the onus on the Biden administration to not only continue the effort, but grow it.\nThat would be a downpayment on the longer-range plans through 2027 and beyond to build out infrastructure and reallocate where US troops – particularly Marines – are stationed around the region. The goal is to disperse troops across multiple locations on multiple islands, providing the Chinese military with a range of hard to find targets, ensuring any one strike wouldn’t only impact a small part of the force.\n“The U.S. and our allies must develop locations that provide expeditionary airfields for dispersal and ports for distributed fleet operations,” the report says. “Ground forces armed with long-range weapons in the First Island Chain allow USINDOPACOM to create temporary windows of localized air and maritime superiority, enabling maneuver. Additionally, amphibious forces create and exploit temporal and geographic uncertainty to impose costs and conduct forcible entry operations.”\nThese basing realignments and temporary facilities would run about $2 billion in 2021, and $6.6 billion between 2023 and 2027 according to the estimates.\nDuring his speech on Monday, Davidson also stressed the need for the US to partner with allies in the Indo-Pacific region, and include them in efforts to push information and intelligence between armed forces.\n“We are developing an integrated architecture to horizontally expand data sharing among like-minded nations through the use of information fusion centers in South Asia and South East Asia, as well as in Oceania,” he said. “These fusion centers will combine and analyze sensor data from aircraft ships and maritime picture between the US, our allies and our partners to improve our collective surveillance of potential illegal fishing trafficking activities and transnational threats.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: As the Biden administration weighs how to manage China, Indo-Pacific Command has crafted a $27.3 billion plan to buy new missile defense systems, place radar and missile defense systems on the ground, launch satellites and build state-of-the-art training ranges across the region.</p>\n<p>The report, delivered today to Capitol Hill, sketches out the budget for the 2022 budget and in the years out to 2027, envisioning a long-range plan that Indo-Pacom head Adm.

{"title": "Cyber Flag 21-2 Showcases New CYBERCOM Training Environment", "publish_time": "2021-06-23 16:06:01", "author": ["Brad D. Williams"], "content": "WASHINGTON: CYBERCOM’s premier defensive tactical exercise, now underway, showcases one of the command’s new training capabilities, known as the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE).\nThis year’s exercise, dubbed Cyber Flag 21-2, takes place on a virtual network for a fictitious allied logistics depot. The exercise isn’t modeled on specific real-world cyber actors or past incidents, but does simulate “threats common in the Indo-PACCOM” geography, noted Lt. Cmdr. Gabe Edwards, Cyber Flag 21-2 exercise lead.\nOne fictitious cyber actor in this year’s event is motivated by cyberespionage, while the other is focused on “denial and destruction,” Coast Guard Rear Adm. Christopher Bartz, chief of exercises and training at CYBERCOM, said in a briefing for reporters. Edwards added that the exercise does include some familiar scenarios, including the possibility of a ransomware payload.\nThere’s also an emphasis on how cyber incidents can affect a wide range of operations. “Specific to this year’s iteration, we focused on the way the cyber domain crosses into other domains,” Bartz said. “We wanted to see all levels. Cross-domain effects were the actual meat of this year’s exercise.”\nCyber Flag 21-2, also known as Big Flag, is commonly called cybersecurity blue teaming. It tests cyber pros’ ability to respond to simulated cyberattacks in a virtual environment. This year’s event is occurring in virtual cyber ranges that are five times larger than previous years and is unfolding across three countries spanning eight time zones.\nPCTE, first used last year during the global pandemic in a full-force exercise, allows DoD to conduct joint cyberspace training, exercises, mission rehearsals, experiments, and certifications. It also allows US and allies to assess missions that cross boundaries and networks.\nPCTE came about because “we needed something bigger and better than we had,” Bartz explained.\n“We can design any scenario we want to create,” Col. Ally Smith, CYBERCOM division chief of exercise design and planning, told reporters. “That puts us out in front of what our adversaries may want to do.”\nThis year’s exercise features 430 pros in 17 cyber protection teams (CPTs) from CYBERCOM’s component commands (Air Force, Army, Marines, Navy), across the Defense Department, National Guard, US House of Representatives, US Postal Service, and other federal agencies. Allies Canada and the United Kingdom are taking part as well. PCTE allows allies — three CPTs from Canada and UK each, in this case — to participate without leaving home, Bartz noted.\nThe participants are cyber operators responsible for the day-to-day defense of assets against real-world cyberattacks. The CPTs work independently of each other during the exercise, although they operate simultaneously on similar virtual networks facing similar cyber scenarios.\nSmith said that PCTE acts a type of “proving ground” to evaluate different scenarios and how well teams respond. The exercise’s goal is to identify what makes effective CPTs and instill those lessons learned to improve real-world cyber defenses. There’s a particular focus on readiness and interoperability among teams.\nCyber Flag 21-2 is a type of “choose-your-own-adventure,” Edwards said.\nCPTs must navigate the virtual cyber ranges to detect, identify, isolate, and counter the fictitious adversaries. As the exercise unfolds, new information comes to light, and teams must evaluate it and make decisions. Teams are challenged to employ a range of advanced defensive measures.\nEdwards noted that PCTE includes the ability to create virtual industrial control system networks, which are how attackers can gain access to and control over technologies that let them carry out potentially destructive attacks against critical infrastructure.\nSmith noted CYBERCOM has some “creative minds willing to push the envelop” in designing these exercises. Edwards noted, “You name [a scenario], and we’re going to try to model it.”\nUltimately, these exercises are designed to keep US and allied cyber talent sharp and best practices updated. “We’re continuously evaluating the proficiency of our force [and] new adversary [tactics, techniques, and procedures],” Bartz said. “We are evolving training at the speed adversaries are evolving TTPs. We must remain one step ahead. CYBERCOM is going to do whatever we can to defend the nation.”", "content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>WASHINGTON: CYBERCOM’s premier defensive tactical exercise, now underway, showcases one of the command’s new training capabilities, known as the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE).</p>\n<p>This year’s exercise, dubbed Cyber Flag 21-2, takes place on a virtual network for a fictitious allied logistics depot.
